{"question": "What are the potential benefits of considering AJ Bell for long-term investment as compared to leaving one's money in cash accounts?", "answer": "Lots of people leave their money in cash, because it seems easier and they havent planned out what they want to do with the money. Rates on cash ISAs have improved since the Bank of England started to raise interest rates with speed and scale in 2022, but they are still unlikely to pay an inflation-beating return. If you assume investments return 5% a year after charges, a 20,000 ISA pot would have grown to 32,577.89 after 10 years. In that same period the cash account with the same 20,000 initial investment earning 3% would have turned into just 26,878.

If you withdraw money before age 60, other than to purchase your first home, you will pay a government withdrawal charge of 25%. This may mean you get back less from your LISA than you paid in. Also, if you choose to save in a Lifetime ISA instead of enrolling in, or contributing to, your workplace pension scheme you will miss out on the benefit of your employers contributions to that scheme and your current and future entitlement to means tested benefits may be affected.

{"question": "What is the purpose of the main residence nil rate band (RNRB) introduced by Fidelity International?", "answer": "In addition to the existing 325,000 nil rate band, known as NRB, a dedicated main residence nil rate band, known as RNRB, is intended to protect the family home from Inheritance Tax. This applies if a home has been left to children (including adopted, foster or stepchildren) or grandchildren (family homes are transferred to spouses and civil partners tax-free). In addition, if your estate is worth less than your threshold when you die and you're married or in a civil partnership, any unused threshold can be added to your partners threshold. This means the tax-free threshold for the surviving spouse could be as much as 1 million."}
{"question": "Can the RNRB be applied if the downsizing or sale of your property occurred after 8 July 2015, enabling the transfer of assets of a comparable value to your direct descendants?", "answer": "The RNRB may also be available to you if youve downsized or sold your home on or after 8 July 2015. This allows assets of an equivalent value to be passed on to your direct descendants."}
{"question": "What is the rate at which the RNRB will be withdrawn for estates with a net value exceeding 2m in a company's offering?", "answer": "For estates with a net value of over 2m, the RNRB will be withdrawn at a rate of 1 for every 2 over the 2m threshold."}
{"question": "What can be found in the passing on wealth section of Fidelity's resources?", "answer": "Your pension is just one way of passing on your wealth.

{"question": "What implications does the current political and market fall-out, weeks after the Chancellor's mini-budget, hold for your investments at Fidelity International?", "answer": "weeks on from the Chancellors infamous mini-budget, the political and market fall-out continues. Tomorrow is being billed as a crunch moment. Whats going on and what does it mean for your investments?"}
{"question": "How did the markets react to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's announcement of unfunded tax cuts and increased government borrowing to support households through the energy crisis, specifically affecting the pound and gilt yields?", "answer": "On 23 September, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced 45bn of unfunded tax cuts, saying he would increase government borrowing to pay for them and the much bigger cost of supporting households through the coming winters energy crisis. The markets voted with their feet. The pound slumped and gilt yields rose sharply as investors demanded a greater reward for lending to a government whose fiscal credibility was now being questioned."}
{"question": "What measures have final salary pension schemes taken, particularly at Fidelity International, to align their assets with future liabilities in light of prolonged low interest rates?", "answer": "uncovered growing pressure on some final salary pension schemes. In recent years they have turned to complex derivative contracts to help them match their assets with their future liabilities during an extended period of very low interest rates."}
{"question": "How has the rise in interest rates impacted counterparties in regards to collateral demands, resulting in pension funds needing to sell assets to generate cash?", "answer": "As interest rates have risen, the counterparties to these contracts have demanded more collateral to maintain the arrangements. Pension funds have been forced to sell assets to generate the cash they needed. The pressure increased dramatically after the mini-budget as bond yields rose sharply. These assets have included easy-to-sell investments like government bonds, or gilts, but also less-liquid assets like property. The sell-off pushed yields yet higher."}
{"question": "What actions is the Bank of England taking to stabilize the market in the short term without compromising its goal of controlling inflation?", "answer": "The Bank of England, with a responsibility for maintaining financial stability as well as keeping a lid on inflation, stepped in, offering to buy government bonds to help stabilise the market in the short term. The problem with this approach, however, is that it runs counter to the Banks other key goal, bringing inflation back to heel. To square this circle, it said its support would only last for a couple of weeks and it has restated that position this week. Its support is due to end on October 14. Thats tomorrow."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of market turbulence on Fidelity International and other financial institutions?", "answer": "That is the trillion-dollar question. The Bank is in a bind. It is talking tough to encourage pension funds to stand on their own two feet, and quickly. And possibly to apply pressure on the government to rethink the unfunded tax cuts that triggered the problem in the first place. But ultimately it cant allow market turbulence to ensue on Monday. And everyone knows that."}
{"question": "How can higher interest rates potentially benefit the ability of pension schemes, like those managed by Fidelity International, to meet their long-term obligations?", "answer": "That depends. If you are in a final salary pension scheme, it is for the trustees and managers of the fund to navigate the short run uncertainty and meet their obligation to pay your pension. The good news is that higher interest rates should help pensions meet their liabilities in the long run."}
{"question": "What impact can recent movements in yields have on the value of a defined contribution pension scheme in relation to government bonds, as stated by Fidelity International?", "answer": "If you are in a defined contribution pension scheme, the value of your pot will reflect the proportion of your fund which has been invested in government bonds, the price of which has been affected by recent movements in yields. But remember, interest rates and bond yields can go down as well as up. A pension is a long-term investment and knee-jerk responses to short-term market movements are never a good idea."}
{"question": "What opportunities can market uncertainty create for investors in their own self-invested pension pots or other investments, particularly in relation to the potential for a higher income and capital gain if central banks adopt easier monetary policy amidst a potential recession?", "answer": "And if you are still contributing to and trying to grow your own self-invested pension pot or other investments then recognise that market uncertainty can create opportunities. For the first time in many years, investors in bonds can now lock in a relatively high income and look forward to the possibility of a capital gain too if central banks pivot to easier monetary policy in the face of a possible recession ahead."}
{"question": "the experts at Fidelity International.", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value. Rising interest rates may cause the value of your investment to fall. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to one of"}
{"question": "What message are central banks, excluding Japan, sending to the market, as evident from this week's actions?", "answer": "not as if Fidelity didnt know it was coming. Jerome Powell could hardly have been clearer at the recent Jackson Hole summit that the Fed will keep up the squeeze until the job is done. But sometimes it takes a week like this one to ram the message home. One after the other, central banks around the world, with the notable exception of Japan, are telling us the same thing."}
{"question": "What is the likelihood of the financial industry, such as Fidelity, moving away from the concept of cheap money due to factors like a depreciating currency?", "answer": "One by one, the guardians of monetary probity are abandoning cheap money. Either because they are choosing to or because a slumping currency is forcing their hand. Pretty soon the aberration of negative interest rates will be for the history books and normal service will have resumed. There will be a cost to borrow money and if you are lucky enough to have some to lend you will be rewarded for doing so. Its a better place for us to be, but getting back there after 15 years in the looking glass world of free money is going to be painful."}
{"question": "What challenges can Fidelity and other investors expect in the next year due to deliberate demand destruction and rising costs in the equity market?", "answer": "Hope springs eternal for investors, especially in the equity market where the default is to seek out the silver lining. But even for stock market investors the penny is now dropping. The next year or so is going to be tough for companies and investors during a period of deliberate demand destruction and rising costs. Somewhat belatedly, the buyers of shares are catching up with the bond market where people are temperamentally more inclined to see the cloud wrapped round that silver lining."}
{"question": "What strategy did central banks employ to encourage investors to shift their money into riskier assets, such as shares, instead of holding cash or bonds?", "answer": "One of the notable features of the post-financial crisis era, and a key driver of the long bull market in shares, was the maintenance by central banks of negative real yields. Keeping bond yields lower than the expected rate of inflation was explicitly designed to drive investors into riskier assets in search of acceptable returns. If you were losing money in inflation-adjusted terms by holding cash or bonds, it was logical to shift your money into shares."}
{"question": "First, as one of the prominent players in the finance sector, what has contributed to the sudden reversal of artificially low bond yields in recent months?", "answer": "and so bond yields, artificially low. In recent months, two things have happened to dramatically reverse that situation. First, as Fidelity know and as"}
{"question": "What is the significance of the policy shift for independent central banks and how does it relate to inflation expectations and the desired outcome of a recession?", "answer": "central banks have relearned their primary purpose. Second, inflation expectations have started to tumble as investors have understood what that policy shift means recession may not be the desired outcome but it will be an acceptable one to independent central banks if that is what it takes to knock inflation on the head."}
{"question": "What are the expectations of inflation falling back to the central banks' targets at Fidelity International?", "answer": "With inflation still in the high single digits on both sides of the Atlantic, it might seem implausible that inflation will fall back to the central banks targets but that is what the"}
{"question": "What is the reason for the decrease in the inflation expectation from 3% to 2.4% over a span of five months, and what role do investors perceiving central banks' statements play in this trend according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "A measure of what investors expect inflation to be in 10 years time, derived from the difference in yield between inflation-linked and nominal bonds, has fallen in just five months from 3%  to 2.4% . Investors are starting to take central banks at their word."}
{"question": "What do investors anticipate regarding the future interest rate hikes, specifically in relation to Fidelity International?", "answer": "At the same time, investors now expect this weeks interest rate hikes to continue for the foreseeable future. By next spring US interest rates are forecast to have reached 4.6% . Bond yields now reflect this reality, with the income on bonds maturing in two years time now above 4% . Far from keeping bond yields well below the expected rate of inflation, they are now well above. The squeeze is real in every sense of the word."}
{"question": "How does the increase in real yields impact the valuation models used by stock market investors, particularly in relation to shares expected to deliver long-term growth?", "answer": "This increase in real yields matters to stock market investors because it is a key input into the valuation models that are used to determine what is a fair value for a share, or indeed the market as a whole. It has a particularly negative impact on those shares that are expected to deliver lots of growth over many years because that future growth in earnings is worth less in todays money when it is discounted back using a higher real yield."}
{"question": "What is the possibility of the S&P 500 index falling by about 10% to 3,500, considering the current valuation multiple and the ongoing reduction in earnings growth expectations?", "answer": "The US stock market is currently valued at around 16 times expected earnings, but todays higher yields make a valuation multiple of between 14 and 15 look more realistic. Shares have fallen hard so far this year, but this suggests that the reset is not quite over yet. A further decline of about 10%  to 3,500 for the S&P 500 index looks plausible. The fall will be amplified if the current reduction in earnings growth expectations has also not yet run its course. I would not be surprised if 2022 turns out to be the worst year for stock markets since 2008."}
{"question": "What are some challenges that investors may face when trying to time the stock market and how does it relate to Fidelity International?", "answer": "What can investors do about this? Not a lot, I would suggest. Finessing a 10%  move in the stock market is not a realistic proposition for a couple of reasons. First, the cost of moving in and out of the market will eat into the potential benefit of watching the final move lower from the side lines. Second, trading a market low requires two decisions not one selling and then buying back in. Human nature being what it is, most of us will fluff that second call."}
{"question": "What is the recommended strategy by a well-known finance company during the current market phase to ensure long-term investments?", "answer": "The best approach during this bottoming phase of the market is to be patient. To remain invested and, indeed, to steadily and systematically put money to work at what, in due course, will look like attractive market levels."}
{"question": "What risks should investors consider when investing in emerging markets compared to more developed markets?", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile than other more developed markets. There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value. Rising interest rates may cause the value of your investment to fall. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to one of"}
{"question": "What is the near impossibility of timing market highs and lows perfectly, and what can investors expect even if they get the general direction of travel right?", "answer": "the near impossibility of timing the markets highs and lows to perfection, investors have to expect that, even if they get the general direction of travel right, their trades will be either too early or too late. Which is better?"}
{"question": "What is a powerful disincentive for the early investor, according to the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "Id say its far better to be early even though human nature ensures that most of us have a tendency to come late to the party. The fear of losing money in the short term, which is the lot of the early investor, is a powerful disincentive to"}
{"question": "What does the finance company consider before making a decision, considering the potential costs and waiting for confirmatory signals from the market and/or the economy?", "answer": "Far easier to wait for confirmatory signals from the market and/or the economy before Fidelity take the plunge. Easier but costly."}
{"question": "What is the importance of staying invested with Fidelity during market recovery instead of waiting for a pull-back to a more favorable price?", "answer": "has been passed, the temptation to keep waiting for a pull-back to a more favourable price is irresistible. Many investors just sit on the sidelines watching other people enjoy the recovery. If you had taken the pain of an initial loss, you would have been in at the bottom and sitting comfortably as the rally gathered pace."}
{"question": "Can Fidelity expect positive returns for both shares and bonds by the end of next year?", "answer": "in the market cycle for both the main asset classes, shares and bonds. I accept that my optimism may be a bit previous on both counts but Im prepared to live with that. I think by the end of next year Fidelity may well look back on a period of positive returns for both investments."}
{"question": "What has this year's performance taught us about the relationship between shares and balanced funds in terms of diversification?", "answer": "That may look eccentric nine months into what will probably turn out to be the worst year for shares since the financial crisis and the worst for balanced funds, holding both assets, perhaps since the 1960s. The idea that the two act as diversifiers for each other has been tested to destruction this year. Persistent inflation and rising interest rates have done for bonds, while shares have tumbled in anticipation of recession and falling earnings."}
{"question": "What impact is the closure of the Bank of England's measures to support the fixed income markets likely to have on bond yields, considering the current dynamics driven by pension funds?", "answer": "looks pretty counter-intuitive in the week that the Bank of England has confirmed that its sticking plaster measures to prop up the UKs fixed income markets will draw to a close. Forced sales by pension funds to plug holes in too-clever-by-half risk management strategies have driven bond yields higher than inflation and interest rates had already taken them."}
{"question": "What are some reasons why bonds are becoming more attractive for investors according to Fidelity International's analysis?", "answer": "Thats bad news for anyone holding those bonds but for anyone looking for an entry point, its a gift. Bonds are looking more interesting than they have done for many years. Even where the rise in yields has not received this liability-driven boost, the adjustment to a world of higher inflation and interest rates has largely happened now. And the additional yield premium on corporate bonds has widened too so that, for the first time in a while, investors are being rewarded for the greater risk of lending to a company rather than a government."}
{"question": "What are the prospects for investors to lock in a decent yield and potentially gain capital while Fidelity navigates through the impact of a looming recession and central banks' shift towards lower interest rates?", "answer": "So, investors can now lock in a decent yield. Even better, as Fidelity head towards recession on both sides of the Atlantic, they can also look forward to a capital gain in due course as the Fed and other central banks take their foot off the monetary gas and pivot to lower interest rates to support a slowing economy. Fidelity are not there yet. The peak in the interest rate cycle probably wont come for another six months or so but before that point actually arrives bond yields will fall in anticipation and their prices will rise."}
{"question": "What can Fidelity expect during this upcoming earnings season in terms of bad loan provisions and the impact of falling demand and unhelpful currencies on US companies?", "answer": "If identifying the low point for bonds looks a bit hasty, it looks even more so for stock markets as Fidelity approach what by all accounts is going to be a tricky earnings season. The banks will kick things off this week with an expected flurry of chunky bad loan provisions. Elsewhere Fidelity should expect plenty of gloomy commentary about falling demand and unhelpful currencies (therell be a lot of talk about the negative impact on US companies of the strong dollar, for example)."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the stock market in relation to the trough in corporate earnings, and how does it relate to the bond market and interest rate cycle?", "answer": "But just as the bond market will pre-empt the peak in the interest rate cycle, so too will the stock market move ahead of the trough in corporate earnings. The market and the earnings cycle are not the same. They march to a different beat and the gap between the two can be as much as six months or so. Prices move first and waiting for the data to confirm the market move can be expensive."}
{"question": "What might be the potential impact on Fidelity if the stock market continues to experience a decrease in valuation multiples?", "answer": "Again, I dont think Fidelity are there yet. So far in 2022 the fall in stock markets has all been about lower valuation multiples. At the beginning of the year, investors were paying 23 times expected earnings; that multiple is now about 15. But a few weeks of disappointing results announcements could easily see that fall to 13 or so. That would imply an S&P 500 of closer to 3,000 than todays 3,500."}
{"question": "What caution should investors exercise when considering their re-entry into the market, as demonstrated during the early weeks of the pandemic, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "If you think you are smart enough to time your re-entry back into the market, then by all means sit on your hands for a bit longer but the early weeks of the pandemic showed how quickly markets can regain lost ground when they get a sniff of recovery and interest rates start to fall again. You wont care too much if you got in at 3,300 or 3,500 once the US benchmark is back above 4,000 again. You will care if you are still waiting in vain for a better entry point."}
{"question": "When should investors consider getting interested in the market according to Fidelity International's advice?", "answer": "Some of the wisest advice for investors is not to get more bearish as the market falls. The time to get interested is when everyone else is focused on the grim economic and corporate outlook. And if you are lucky enough to get double helpings in both the bond and stock market so much the better. Time to grit your teeth and start to prepare for the upturn. Even if it hurts in the short term."}
{"question": "Are there any potential risks associated with investing in bonds issued by companies other than Fidelity International?", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates. There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value. Rising interest rates may cause the value of your investment to fall. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment.

{"question": "How can diversifying asset classes in accordance with your goals and risk tolerance minimize the impact on your portfolio, as suggested by a leading finance company?", "answer": "Holding a diverse range of asset classes in line with your goals and risk tolerance will help minimise the impact of one on your portfolio."}
{"question": "What suggestions does Fidelity have to assist with the challenging task of determining how much of your pension to withdraw during retirement?", "answer": "Fidelity know it can be hard to work out how much to take from your pension when you retire. After all, you want to enjoy yourself and make the most of your hard-earned savings, but they also need to last throughout your retirement. Fidelity have some ideas to help you with this difficult decision."}
{"question": "What is the potential risk for bondholders when it comes to repayment by governments in less developed countries compared to the US or UK government, according to Interactive Investor?", "answer": "It is extremely unlikely that the US or UK government will not repay their loans. But there is a greater risk that governments in less developed countries will be able to repay bondholders."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between the current market inflation rate and the interest payment of Indexlinked bonds issued by a certain finance company?", "answer": "Indexlinked bonds, also known as inflationlinked bonds, pay a level of interest that is linked to the current rate of inflation in the market where the bonds are issued."}

{"question": "What topic will Royal London be discussing in today's webinar?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And in today's webinar, Royal London're gonna be talking about what happens when you're gone. Now, I know it sounds like a fairly morbid topic, but death is something that, sadly, none of us can avoid, and Royal London know, from the number of questions that Royal London get that people do want to prepare for what happens when they die. Now, death can be an awful time for family and friends, and it can be made worse if, for example, finances are complex, if family members don't get on or if they struggle to talk about death. Now, this week is Dying Matters Awareness Week, which is designed to encourage people to talk about death, dying and grief, so it seemed like a good time for us to be talking about this topic."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the State Pension and what happens to it when an individual passes away, according to Royal London's webinar?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Royal London've read every question that came in and Royal London'd like to say a big thank you if you submitted a question ahead of this webinar. Royal London'll be answering some of the most popular questions in the next 45 minutes or so, but if you'd like to ask a question as Royal London go through, Royal London've left some time at the end to answer them and Royal London'd love to hear from you. But, as with all of Royal London webinars, Royal London can't answer a question that's about your specific circumstances or a Royal London policy. Now, if you'd like to leave a comment or a question, you can do so via the Slido link, but before Royal London go any further, I'd just like to remind you that Royal London're recording this webinar and Royal London'll share the link to the recording afterwards with everyone who registered for it. So, Sarah, Royal London often get asked questions about what happens to your pension when you die, but shall Royal London begin with State Pensions? Now, just about every one of us will get a State Pension, so it's worth knowing what happens to that when you die, and it's exactly what Linda and Alistair wanted to know when they submitted their questions when they registered for the webinar."}
{"question": "What are the new rules regarding inheriting someone's State Pension and how much can you potentially inherit, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And it is a really good question but I think, before I answer it, I'd like to do Royal London first poll. So, to flip the question round, do you know what happens to your State Pension when you die? So, please vote now using Slido. Okay, so just getting some votes coming in. Most people at the moment are saying they don't know, but about one in five people saying they, they do know, one in four, and, and quite a number of people saying, 'Not really thought about it,' which is, kind of, understandable. It's not one of those things that you need to think-, you necessarily think about until, you know, possibly you feel you have to. So, okay, I, I guess I would say, at the moment, it's settled down, it's saying 53% of people who voted don't know, and those results are not surprising because there isn't a one-line answer. The answer depends on when you reach State Pension age, and that, as Royal London've mentioned, if you've joined Royal London previous webinars, is when you can claim your State Pension, not when you retire. Now, the crucial date to bear in mind is April 6th 2016 because that's when the new State Pension system was introduced, and that system brought with it some new rules on when you could inherit someone's State Pension and how much you may be able to inherit."}
{"question": "What is the significance of a protected payment in the State Pension system offered by Royal London?", "answer": "So, if you haven't yet reached State Pension age or you were able to claim your State Pension on or after April 6th 2016, then your husband, wife or civil partner may be able to inherit part of what's called a protected payment when you die. So, I'll explain this a bit more with a slide. So, before April 2016, there was the basic State Pension system, and if you were employed, and for a while, if you were on benefits, then you could build up an additional pension. Now, that two-tier structure was abolished in 2016 but you were able to keep what you'd built up before then if it was more than you would get under the new State Pension system. Now, this bit that you could keep is called the protected payment and it was designed to make sure that you weren't worse off when the new system was introduced. So, some people have this protected payment as part of their State Pension, and part of that element can be passed on to your husband, wife or civil partner when you die."}
{"question": "Can you inherit part of your partner's State Pension if they reached State Pension age before a specific date and died before another specific date?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, they are. So, if-, Royal London'll, Royal London'll look now at if your husband, wife or civil partner reached State Pension age before that date because it's the age of the person-, it, it's the date the person reaches State Pension age that determines whether you can inherit any of their State Pension. So, in that case, if they reach State Pension age before April 6th 2016 or if it was after then but they died before April 26th-, April 6th 2016, then, in that case, you could inherit part of their additional State Pension. That's the pension I just mentioned that, kind of, sits on top of the old basic State Pension system. Now, I'm aware that this is probably quite head-melty and I don't want to go into more detail because I think it is quite complicated, but hopefully, that's given you a bit of an idea of the principle of what you may be able to inherit and why this date of April 6th is so important. Now, there is a really useful section of the gov.uk website that you can go to and you can put in details of your own situation, and then you'll get information on what you might be able to inherit. So, the website address is www.gov.uk/state-pension-through-partner. Now, don't worry if you don't have those details because Royal London'll have information about this, this link and any other links that Royal London mention in the webinar when Royal London send out details of the recording, which will go to everyone who's registered. Now, one last thing before Royal London leave the topic of State Pensions, which is that you can't inherit parts of your husband, wife or civil partner's pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age."}
{"question": "What are the benefits available in a workplace pension scheme offered by Royal London for individuals in different types of pension schemes?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, if you have a workplace pension, then the benefits that are available to you depend on the type of workplace pension scheme that you're in. Now, you might have heard about a defined benefit pension, now that's the type of pension where you get a regular payment. The employer promises to pay you a regular payment for the rest of your life, and that normally starts when you stop work. It's more commonly described as a final salary pension, but that's actually one type of defined benefit pension. Now, these days, you're most likely to see defined benefit pensions in the public sector. Now, the second type of pension is called a defined contribution pension, that's the type where a pension provider offers you, either individually or through your job, and in this case, you build up a pot of money and then you use that money to provide you with an income when you retire. And this is the type of pension that you're likely to be in, either through your workplace if you're in the private sector or if you've taken out a pension individually, a personal pension. Now, some people, of course, may have a mix of both of these types of pensions. So, Clare, first of all, tell us what happens if you have a defined contribution pension when you die."}
{"question": "What is the most common way that death benefits for defined contribution pensions are paid out by the pension company that Clare Moffat from Royal London mentioned?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, before I do that, to get one piece of jargon out of the way, when Royal London talk about who might be entitled to your pension when you die, Royal London're going to use the term beneficiaries. Now, that simply means the person or people who'll receive your pension or other assets. Now, it could be your closest family member, such as your husband or wife or partner, but it's not always the case. It could be friends or charities or trusts. Now, Royal London've had so many questions about passing on pensions and what happens to your pension when you die, including from Alex, Agnes, Jean and many, many more people. So, Royal London're going to take some time to explain this. Now, the next part, it's a bit tricky but it's important to know about the way that death benefits for defined contribution pensions are paid out by the pension company. Now, hopefully, this slide helps. Let's look at the left-hand side of the slide. The most common way is called 'discretion', now, that means that you can tell the pension company who you would like to receive your pension but they don't have to follow these instructions."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of filling out an expression of wish or nomination of beneficiary form in a pension scheme offered by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, that sounds a bit odd, but the important point is the pension company will pay who they think you want to get your pension, and that can be anybody. Now, Royal London had a question from Anna, who said, 'Who can be a beneficiary if I have no dependents?' And the answer is that, in most pensions, that you can choose anybody, as Clare just mentioned, friends, family, but also charities and so on. So, the first thing is that when you join a pension scheme through your workplace, you'll be asked to fill in a, a-, an expression of wish or it's sometimes called a nomination of beneficiary form, and this is the form where you put down the names of the person or people you'd like to receive your pension. Now, they are your beneficiaries."}
{"question": "What would happen if my form for expressing my pension beneficiaries through an online platform was recently filled and my circumstances remained unchanged, according to the company's investigation process, if I were to pass away?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, so, as you've said, Sarah, you fill in an expression of wish paper form or online or via the app. Now, for example, I've said that I'd like my husband and three children to receive my pension. If I died, the company would investigate. They'd look at how recently I filled in my form and any other evidence, to find out what I wanted to happen. If my form was recent and my circumstances hadn't changed, then they'd offer my husband and children the pension death benefits."}
{"question": "What benefits could Royal London provide to your children and a new child if you haven't filled in a form and experienced life changes like having another baby or getting divorced?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And, Clare, if you hadn't filled in a form, then they would still find out who should get the benefits, or if you'd had another baby or got divorced, then they could, for example, give more to your children and the new child."}
{"question": "What are the advantages of passing on your pension through discretion with respect to Inheritance Tax and promptness of death benefits payout, as discussed by Clare Moffat from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Exactly, there's this flexibility, which means your pension should always be going to the right people. It also means that your pension won't normally be subject to Inheritance Tax. Now, you might think that Inheritance Tax doesn't apply to you, but passing on your pension in this way, discretion, also means that your family won't have to wait until your will, or intestacy if you don't have a will, is sorted out to offer the death benefits, so it can be paid out much quicker. If you've got an up-to-date expression of wish or nomination form or you've updated the app recently, then this shows exactly who you would like to receive your pension when you die, but, Sarah, I know you've seen some examples of cases where these forms weren't up to date."}
{"question": "What is the most common way for a pension provider like Royal London to decide who should receive a pension payment after someone dies, besides using discretion or making the final decision themselves?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, I have. Now, I did once see a form that was twenty years old and the man had been married at the time he'd filled it in but he'd then married another four times and had had children in every relationship. So, it was really tricky to work out what he actually wanted to happen with his pension, but the pension company investigated, and that included getting a lot of evidence from family members, from the solicitor, the financial advisor and so on, but they worked out who to pay. Now, not every case is going to be as tricky as this, but filling in your form or doing this online or via your provider's app is really important, especially if there are any changes in your life. But, Clare, you mentioned that there's discretion or, you know, the company making the final decision is the most common way for a pension provider to decide who should receive a pension payment after someone dies, but what about the other way?"}
{"question": "What is the importance of keeping nomination of beneficiary forms up-to-date in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, there is a way where whoever you say should be paid is paid. Now, if Royal London look at the slide again, this time the right-hand side, the company will pay whoever is named on the form without investigation. Now, this way means that Inheritance Tax might need to be paid if you're over the Inheritance Tax limit because it's you that's making the final decision about what happens, like you would with any other asset you would leave. Now, it means that it's even more important to keep nomination of beneficiary forms up-to-date, and if the form was filled out years ago, it could mean that, for example, and ex-spouse would receive the money. Now, if you haven't filled in the form, then the pension company will pay to your executors if you have a will. Now, those are the people who you name in your will and they have a legal responsibility for making sure that the wishes in your will are carried out."}
{"question": "What should Jane do to ensure that her pension assets can be left to her children after her death according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, if I go back to the example of the man who'd been married five times, if his pension was set up in that way, that would have meant his first wife would have received the money and nobody else, and that's why it's not as common to see this because it's really useful for the pension company to have some flexibility about who your pension is paid to if you die. Now, on a related topic, Royal London had a question from Jane about whether she could leave her pension asset to her children when she dies. Now, the answer to that-, to that would normally be yes, but, Jane, you might want to make sure you've filled out your expression of wish or nomination of beneficiary form recently and that it does reflect your current wishes."}
{"question": "What is the significance of receiving two forms about the consequences in case of death when starting a new job at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Now, Royal London've had another question from Colin, which I think's really important too. 'I've just started a new job and I've been sent two forms about what happens if I die. Are they both the same?'"}
{"question": "What percentage of respondents have filled in both forms according to the Slido poll conducted by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: No. I suspect that one of these forms relates to the pension, but the other form is for something called 'death in service' and these are two separate benefits. Now, death in service benefit is an amount of money that would be paid out if you died while you were still working for that company, but if you left the job or you retired, then you wouldn't get a death in service payment. Now, it's most common to see death in service benefit as a multiple of your salary, so your beneficiaries might get a lump sum that's work, for example, four times your salary. Now, while death in service would only be paid out if you died while working for your employer, your pension is entirely separate. Now, it might well be that you want your death in service benefit and your pension to go to the same person or people or organisation, but that isn't necessarily the case. You might want them to go to different people. So, Colin, do make sure that you've filled out both the forms. So, before Royal London go any further, linked to what I've just been talking about, I think, let's do another poll, and I'd like to know if you filled in both forms from your employer or whether you think you just filled in the, the pension form, death in service only or you're not sure, so please vote now using the Slido link. Okay, well, this is very impressive, over-, about 80%, so four in five, have filled in both forms, which is fantastic, so great stuff."}
{"question": "What is the importance of checking if both forms have been filled in at Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, really good news, actually. Some are-, some are not sure actually, that, that's now coming up. I said it was 80%, it's now come down to 50% but it really is worth checking, and I think it is confusing. People don't necessarily expect to have two forms but, you know, it's really worth going back and just checking to see whether you have filled in both those forms."}
{"question": "What does Royal London offer in terms of death benefits in a fully flexible defined contribution pension scheme?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, let's go into more detail now about who can receive benefits. So, you might be paying into your defined contribution pension or you might have moved your pension pot into income drawdown, so you could take a regular income from it, or you might have both. If you die, then the choices for your beneficiaries are normally the same but it is worth checking with your pension, though. Now, Royal London're going to be talking about what happens in a fully flexible defined contribution pension scheme, so that just means it offers a full choice of death benefits but also that they can be paid to anyone, but there are some old pensions where the choice is more limited in relation to the benefits and also who can receive. So, it's something that you should check. Now, it's-, Royal London've explained that you can choose who you would like to receive your defined contribution pension when you die but it's up to the person or, or the people chosen to pick how they would like to receive it. So, again, I think this might be better explained on-screen. So, here, Royal London've got the person with the pension pot. Now, they've said they would like their three grown-up children to receive the money. The children are 19, 21 and 23. Now, on the person's death, the pension company have looked at the expression of wish form, they've done that investigation and then they've chosen to offer the death benefits to the children."}
{"question": "How does Royal London provide options for pension money distribution, including cash lump sum, income drawdown, or annuity, to ensure a guaranteed regular income?", "answer": "Now, there is a choice of how the pension money could be paid, so they could have a cash lump sum, taking it all out, they could move it into income drawdown or they could buy an annuity. Now, that would give them a guaranteed regular income for life, but that would be fairly unusual now. So, let's say the youngest child wants to take all of the money out as a lump sum because she wants to go travelling. So, the money leaves the pension scheme and it goes into her bank account. The middle child, well, they're at university, and the eldest is working and they want some help with expenses, so both don't want a lump sum, and instead, they prefer a regular income but maybe the opportunity to take more out sometimes. So, they take advice on how this should be invested from a financial advisor, and then the money is moved from that-, the parents' pot into their own drawdown fund."}
{"question": "Can a beneficiary under the age of 57 take income from their pension if it is left to them by someone who passes away?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, that's an important point, that your children or whoever your pension is paid to after you die don't have to take it as a lump sum if they don't want to, but equally, if that works best for them, then they can, and on a related point, Michael has asked a really good question, which is, 'If you leave your pension to somebody under the age of 57, can they take income from it subject to tax?' And again, this is a common query because normally, pensions can't be paid out before someone is age 55, and that age threshold is due to rise to 57 in April 2028, so five years' time. Now, when someone is a beneficiary and chooses drawdown, it works the same as drawdown for somebody who's over the age of 55, but the difference is that you can access it at any age. It is important to point out, as Clare mentioned a moment ago, that that pension money is invested though, so, as with regular drawdown, getting financial advice is important. Now, the children can take out a regular income every month, every year or not at all. Well, I hope, Michael, that that answers your question."}
{"question": "What is a common question about passing on pensions through multiple generations that Royal London often gets asked?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And another common question Royal London get asked is about passing on pensions through multiple generations, and again, I think it's useful to look at a slide. So, if you have been a beneficiary and you chose to move that money into drawdown but perhaps you've not taken any money out or there's some money left in the pot when you die, then your fund can also pass on to who you would like to receive it too, and if they die, it can be passed on again and again and again until there's no money left. So, if you are a beneficiary and decide to put the money into drawdown, of course, you need to remember and fill in an expression of wish form too. Now, there's another point that Royal London need to flag up here though, and again, this sounds quite complex but it's important. Putting everyone you might, theoretically, want to benefit on your expression of wish form is key. Now, again, I think this is better talked through with a slide, so let's go back to your example of the three children. If there'd been an old expression of wish form or nomination form, say it was an ex-spouse on it instead of the children, well, the pension company have decided that the children should receive the benefits, but there's a problem around what they can offer to all of the beneficiaries, excuse me. And that's because there are only two dependents that are alive, excuse me, I've got a bit of a cough."}
{"question": "What happens if someone names their adult children as beneficiaries instead of their spouse for their pension in Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, no, no problem. So, and that's because, as Clare said, there are only two dependents who are alive. Children under 23 and husbands and wives, including those who are separated but not divorced, and someone who's financially dependent on the member officially count as dependents. Now remember, the youngest one did a lump sum and the middle child wanted drawdown, now they're both under 23 so that's fine as dependents can be offered a full range of benefits. But the third is 23 and because they aren't a dependent of the member and the other dependents are alive, they can only receive a lump sum, so the choice is limited and that could also mean they pay a lot of tax. Now, Royal London'll have more on tax later, so this doesn't affect who can be paid but how they get it. However, if there's an expression of wish form and all three are named on the form, the full choice is available to them. Now, this is quite complex but Royal London've had a question from Ron that deals with this issue and hopefully should illustrate exactly what Royal London've been describing. And he says that he nominated his wife to receive his pension when he dies, but what happens if she doesn't want the money and instead wants their adult children to receive it? Now, as Clare mentioned, Ron's wife would be a dependent and, if he wants his adult children to have all the options available, if they were to receive his pension, then he should put their names on the form or else they may be limited to only being able to take a lump sum and possibly paying more tax. Now, sometimes you see people put their spouse's name on a form and they'll say they'd like 98% of their pension to go to their husband, wife or civil partner and then, say, 1% for each child if they've got two children. What that's really telling the pension company is, 'I'd like my husband, wife or civil partner to get the money in my pension but, if he or she isn't alive or doesn't need it, then my children's names are on the form so they can access the full range of benefits.' But Clare, I've mentioned tax, you mentioned it earlier, so I think Royal London need to move on to taxation, and Royal London've had many questions, including one from Ken about this."}
{"question": "What is the importance of financial advice when the lifetime allowance is applicable in a defined contribution pension offered by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, so this is something else which is, excuse me, which is different depending on whether your pension is a defined benefit pension or a defined contribution pension. Now, if you're receiving a pension from a defined benefit pension, it is taxable and it doesn't matter what age the person who died was. So for example, I'm married to a police officer, if he died before the age of 75, the pension I would receive would be treated the same as any other income and would sit on top of my salary and I would pay income tax as usual. But if you're the beneficiary of someone who is in a defined contribution pension, and if Royal London have a look at slide six, here, then that would mean that they're still saving into their pension-, if they're still saving into their pension, or if they've moved into drawdown, if they die when they're under 75 and it's paid out within two years of their death, then for most people there is no income tax to pay. Now, if something called the lifetime allowance applied then financial advice is really important because the law on this is changing right now."}
{"question": "What are the potential tax benefits for beneficiaries of a 65-year-old individual's pension with a value of \u00a3500,000 in a certain finance company?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, if someone dies and they're 65, you know, if they had a pension of, say, 500,000, that could go to their beneficiaries and they wouldn't pay income tax at all on it."}
{"question": "What benefits does Royal London offer in terms of pension payout options in case of the policyholder's death before the age of 75?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: That's right, Sarah. So back to my example, if I died when I was under 75, my husband could take my pension as a lump sum or regular income from drawdown and he wouldn't have any income tax to pay."}
{"question": "What are the implications for individuals aged 75 or over in accessing a defined contribution pension after the pension freedoms introduced by Royal London in 2015?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: The difference between defined benefit and defined contribution sounds a bit unfair but the advantage of a defined benefit pension is, you know, they're payable for the rest of your life and including someone's partner's life in that is a very valuable benefit. One of the advantages, though, of defined contribution pension is that, in 2015, Royal London had the pension freedoms and that changed a lot about how people and their beneficiaries could access a defined contribution pension. Now, Clare, you talked about how someone dies under 75, what if they're aged 75 or over?"}
{"question": "What tax implications does a beneficiary face if they take a cash lump sum of the full pension value from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, Kenneth asked about this as he said, 'I'm told my pension pot can be left to my son and daughter free of tax if I die after I'm 75, is that correct?' Now, sadly, the answer to that is no. And again, I think it might be useful to look at the slide again, from age 75 onwards, a beneficiary will pay income tax at the right amount for their income, so that's called your marginal rate. So for example, say the member died with a pension pot of 200,000. If their beneficiary took a regular income from their beneficiaries' drawdown pot of 20,000 a year and their yearly salary was 20,000 then they would be a basic rate taxpayer because the total income in that tax year would be 40,000. But if they wanted to take the whole amount out as a cash lump sum, they'd be taking that full pension value of 200,000, which would mean they would have an income of 220,000 for that year, which would mean some would be taxed at basic rate, some at higher rate and a lot of that money would be taxed additional rate tax of 45%, or 47% in Scotland."}
{"question": "What are the potential tax benefits for taking multiple lump sums from a finance company like Royal London for purposes like buying a house?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, but if you do want to take a larger amount out, so say you want to buy a house, then you can take a lump sum out. Now, in that case, even splitting it, so perhaps you would take two lump sums over two tax years, one at the end of the tax year and one at the beginning of the next tax year, well, that would mean that you might pay less tax."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the age 75 change in tax for beneficiaries in drawdown with Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, so just to recap, it's not the passing on the pension that could mean the beneficiary pays income tax, it's the act of taking money out of that inherited pension that means income tax is deducted. Now, and it's an important point to know about the age 75 change in tax, it's the age of the person who died that's important when Royal London're thinking about beneficiaries drawdown. So, if the first person was to die at the age of 76 then any money taken out would have income tax deducted. But if, if the beneficiary moved it into drawdown and didn't spend it all and then died at the age of 70 and passed it onto their beneficiary, then no income tax would be due."}
{"question": "What are the implications for individuals who possess a guaranteed income within their pension, considering the changes brought about by pension freedoms introduced in 2015, as discussed by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, that's right. Now, Royal London've been talking about what happens if you have a defined contribution pension pot or around drawdown. But of course, what happens if you've got a guaranteed income with your pension? Which some, you know, many people did before pension freedoms were introduced in 2015."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a joint life annuity and a single life annuity with a guarantee?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: That's right, now if you were married or living with your partner, you have bought what's called a joint life annuity and that's a product that's designed to pay you a guaranteed regular income while you're alive and then, when you die, it's make a regular payment to your husband, wife or partner. Basically, whoever's name is on the annuity aside from your own. And they will get the regular payment when you die. Now, it's normally a percentage of the amount that you received rather than the same amount, but that's something you would have been able to choose when you took out the annuity. And you'd have been able to pick an amount, generally, it's between 10 and 90% of your pension. Now, the higher the amount of pension that you said you wanted your beneficiary to get, then in very general terms, the lower the amount of pension that you would have received. However, a number of factors would've come into play, such as your age and the age of your husband, wife or partner, the beneficiary. As well as your and their health. Now, in this case, the pension-, the beneficiary would have to contact the pension provider and tell them that you died and provide evidence of this, the death certificate in order to get that pension payment. Now, Royal London know that, in the past, a lot of people who were married or in a civil partnership or living with their partner actually bought so-called single life annuities. Now, if you take one of these out, they're only designed to pay out while you're alive. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the payments will stop when you die. Now, that sounds contradictory, but the reason is that there are different types of single life annuity. If you've taken out a straightforward single life annuity, then the payments would stop when you died. But if you've taken out a single life annuity with a guarantee then it's slightly different. These annuities pay out for a set period, a guaranteed period and it's typically something like five or ten years. And that payment carries on whether or not you're alive."}
{"question": "What are the death benefits for the NHS pension scheme if a nurse like Constance decides to leave the NHS after ten years of service?", "answer": "Now, as Clare mentioned, annuities used to be really popular before the pension freedoms were introduced in 2015. But these days, most people who have defined contribution pensions either take lump sums out of it directly or go into income drawdown when they retire. And in that case, as Royal London've been discussing, the money goes straight to your beneficiaries. Well, time for a bit of a change of topic now because Royal London've had a question from Constance, who's a nurse in the NHS and she says she's thinking of leaving the NHS after ten years' service, during which she was a member of the NHS pension scheme and she wonders what that means for her NHS pension scheme death benefits. And Royal London've had quite a few questions about this, haven't Royal London, Clare?"}
{"question": "What is the payout structure for public sector pensions offered by Royal London in the event of the policyholder's death?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, Royal London get asked a lot of questions about public sector pensions and, as Royal London said at the beginning, public sector pensions are defined benefit pensions. Now, with defined benefit pensions, if you die, there will normally be a regular pension which is paid to a surviving husband, wife or partner. Now, this will often be a set percentage of your regular pension and there might be a lump sum paid too."}
{"question": "What are the potential implications of leaving a defined benefit pension for individuals and their family members, especially in comparison to being a member of the Royal London pension scheme?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, that sounds quite simple but it is made a bit more complicated if you leave a defined benefit pension like Constance has asked about. Now, in that case, you will still get a pension and family members will still get a pension and possibly a lump sum, but that won't be as generous as if you were still a member of the pension scheme."}
{"question": "Can individuals working for a public sector organization opt out of contributing to their pension scheme while still being employed there, according to Clare Moffat from the finance company mentioned?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, and it's not just when people stop working for the public sector, it also could be if they decide to stop paying into the pension but they might still be working for that public sector organisation."}
{"question": "What are the death benefits available for active members in the 2015 scheme of a public sector pension, such as Royal London's?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, and there are similarities between all public sector pension schemes but they are not exactly the same. So if you are a member of a defined benefit pension or you were in the past, it's best to check with them. But let's go back to Constance's question and run through the death benefits available for active members. Now that means those who are still in the scheme. Those who are-, who have left the scheme but were previously members, they are known as deferred members and you become a deferred member if you stop working for an employer or if you're still working but have decided not to pay into a pension as Royal London were just explaining. Now, the rules around particular public sector pensions have been updated over the years, but all NHS pension scheme members are now in what's called the 2015 scheme. So it will focus on that. It would get far too confusing if I tried to give details of all the older versions of the scheme, so Clare, can you just talk us through how that works?"}
{"question": "What is the lump sum death benefit for active members of a pension scheme at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Of course. So let's start with the lump sum death benefit. So if someone is an active member, so they haven't left the NHS or chosen to leave the pension scheme but are still working, their beneficiaries will get two times their pay as a lump sum. But deferred members will get 025 times the pension built up as a lump sum paid to beneficiaries."}
{"question": "What is the pension that the husband, wife, or partner of Constance might receive from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, they're getting a slightly higher percentage but it's based on the pension they built up so far and not their pay. So, I think an example would work best here. So, say Constance had a salary of 40,000 a year and has built up a pension worth 8,000 a year at the date she dies. If she's still an active member, then Constance's family would get 80,000. That's two times her 40,000 salary. But if she's a deferred member, they would get 16,200, that's 025 times the pension she's built up so far, which Royal London said is worth 8,000 a year. So that's a huge difference. Now, in addition to that, beneficiaries of active scheme members also get something called a short-term pension, which is around six months' pay and that's to help with the costs of bereavement. But that's not the case for deferred members. But Clare, what about the pension that her husband, wife or partner might get?"}
{"question": "What is the importance of filling in nomination forms or expression of wish forms for people in defined benefit schemes according to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, the first thing to note is that the person has to have been a member of the pension scheme for two years. Now, if they have, their husband, wife or partner will receive a pension for the rest of their life. Now, this is about a third of the benefits the member's built up. So, say the member has built up 27,000 of pension benefits a year, their husband or wife would get 9,000. And that's for beneficiaries of active and deferred members, but there is an extra part which is paid on top of that only if someone dies as an active member. Now, how much depends on how long it is to go until the member State Pension age. But it is 50%, or half, of the number of years. So if an active member has twenty years until their State Pension when they die, their partner will get that third that I mentioned, the 9,000 in the example I used, plus an additional ten years of benefits. Now, remember that's paid for life and it increases each year by the consumer prices index. Now, that can be quite a difference, particularly for younger pension scheme members. Now, there's also something called dependent children's pensions and similar rules apply. And it's also really important for people in defined benefit schemes to fill in their nomination forms or expression of wish forms too. But Sarah, I think Royal London've covered a lot about pensions, but what about wills?"}
{"question": "What are the consequences of dying without a will in terms of the distribution of one's money and possessions according to the rules of intestacy?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, before I talk about wills, I'd just like us to do a poll, so if you can use the Slido link and vote, please, the question is have you made a will? Okay, so it's interesting, it's a bit of a, sort of, battle going between people who are saying, 'Yes, it's up-to-date,' and those who are saying they put it off. About one in four saying yes, they have a will but need to update it. At the moment, four in ten saying it's up-to-date and about 35% saying, 'No, I keep putting it off.' And I think, I think all these responses, actually, are understandable. I think it is particularly understandable about people putting it off, it is one of those things which I will be talking about in a moment. Now, the main reason for having a will is to set out how your money and possessions, which you might hear being described as your estate, is divided up when you die. Now, if you die without a will, that's called dying intestate and, if you do that, then the money and possessions that you have will be distributed according to the rules of intestacy and that could be very different to your wishes. So, first of all, apologies for the legal jargon but it, kind of, goes with the territory. But, for example, if you live with your partner but you're not married, or if you have stepchildren who haven't been legally adopted or foster children, they don't have an automatic right to inherit under intestacy rules. So, you could have a situation where a couple have been living together for twenty years, they've both been paying towards the house and the household bills, but the house has been owned by one person. Now, if they die without a will, that house will go to the closest family member of the person who owned it. Now, that could be children or parents or, if they didn't have children or parents weren't alive, it could be a more distant relative. You, as the surviving partner, would have no automatic right to inherit. Now, you might be able to take legal action for a share of the house, but there's no guarantee that you'll get anything, especially if there are children."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of having a will, particularly for those left behind, according to Sarah Pennells from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Absolutely, I mean, as you say, it's the last thing you want to face. Now, a will means that your estate goes where you want it to and, when you draw up a will, you can also say who you would like to act as your executors and these are the people who ensure that the instructions in your will are carried out when you die. There are several other things you can do if you have a will. You can say who you would like to act as guardians of your children, any children you have, if, for example, both parents were to die at the same time, and if they're under the age of eighteen, it's sixteen in Scotland. Now, if you don't do this, the state will decide who has responsibility for your children. If you have any pets, you can also say what you'd like to happen to them when you have a will. Now, I mentioned about a third of people saying they put off drawing up a will and how understandable that is and I know too, all too well how easy it is to put off drawing up a will. I mean, I was a financial journalist for many years before I joined Royal London and I talked about and wrote about the importance of having a will. But even I put it off for a few years. Now, I have had a will for many years but I know I could've probably sorted it out a few years earlier. I have to be honest and say it was only when my parents died a few years ago that I think I really understood first-hand how important it was to have a will. Sorting out the financial affairs of a parent who's died is really tough, but both my parents had a will and they told me and my sister about it and, in fact, they'd given both my sister and myself a copy of it. So when I was sorting out probate for them, I did know that I was carrying out their wishes and that did make things easier for both of us. I think one of the benefits, as I mentioned earlier on, of having a will, is that you can decide who gets what and set out, you know, what happens to your business, pets and so on. But I believe that having a will is also an act of kindness for those people you leave behind."}
{"question": "What benefits can individuals gain from planning their finances with a company like Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Sometimes people don't want to think about what would happen if they died or perhaps their circumstances are complex, but taking that time to plan will really help your family."}
{"question": "What are the variations in laws across different regions of the UK when it comes to drawing up a will, Clare?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yep, that's absolutely right. And I think that's especially the case as, you know, families are more complex than they were a few years ago. Now, I've talked about, you know, drawing up a will, but the law varies around the UK, doesn't it, Clare?"}
{"question": "What is the importance of writing a correct will based on the specific laws of the country you reside in, according to Clare Moffat from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: That's right. So, the law in England and Wales, then Scotland and then Northern Ireland, well, in relation to writing wills and intestacy, it's quite different. So, you need to make sure that any will that you write is correct for where you live. So, for example, I live in Scotland, so if I went to the shop and bought a ready-made will and it was based on English law then there could be problems. In addition, in Scotland, even if you have a will you can't actually write your children or spouse out of it. So, say I said I wanted to give everything I own to a friend, the law here says that my husband and children would still be entitled to something. And if you have any assets abroad, like a house in Spain, for example, you would need to check out the situation in that country. And inheritance tax, Sarah, tell us about that."}
{"question": "What is the nil rate band offered by Royal London for inheritance tax purposes in relation to property values?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, now, inheritance tax is a potential issue. So, if that's the case for you, you can also use your will to set up trusts and other arrangements to keep inheritance tax to a minimum. Now, more and more inheritance tax is being paid, and one of the reasons is because of the rise in property values. Now, Royal London all have something called a nil rate band, which is worth 325,000, and that means that if the money in property that you leave behind is worth less than 325,000 then there's no inheritance tax to pay when you die. Now, there's also something called the residence nil rate band, and that's worth 175,000 and that means if you own your own home and you want to pass it to your child, or children or grandchild then you get an extra allowance of 175,000. Now, that kicks in even, perhaps, if your house was sold to pay for care, care home fees as well, it still applies."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the million-pound figure that Royal London is hearing about in relation to potential inheritance tax payments?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, Sarah, you've mentioned that there could be 325,000 plus that 175,000, potentially, so that's before inheritance tax would be paid, but tell us about this magic million-pound figure that Royal London hear about."}
{"question": "What is the spousal exemption for inheritance tax in relation to couples who are married or in a civil partnership?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, as you say, I just mentioned the two inheritance tax allowances, but if a couple are married or in a civil partnership and the first person to die leaves everything to their husband, wife or civil partner, then there's no inheritance tax to pay anyway as there's what's called a spousal exemption. Now, the rules say husbands, wives and civil partners can leave as much of their assets and property to each other as they like and there is no inheritance tax to pay. Now, instead, their nil rate bands, that 325,000 I mentioned, will be transferred, which means that when the second partner dies, there can be the total of 1 million before inheritance tax is paid. There's the 325,000 that each get plus that residence nil rate band if they own their own home and have children or grandchildren. Now, but if you live with a partner, and you're not married and you die first then you don't get that spousal exemption, so there may be inheritance tax to pay if the total value of the estate, the money and possessions you leave, is worth more than 325,000."}
{"question": "What is the importance for individuals who live together but are not married to be aware of the legal disparities as highlighted by Clare Moffat from a finance company?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And that's back to what you were speaking about earlier, for people who live together and aren't married, then they need to understand that there are differences in the law."}
{"question": "What is the significance of having a will for most people and how can one obtain a will?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, now, Royal London mentioned at the beginning, which might feel like quite a long time ago, that your pension isn't normally covered by your will but your house or flat may be, and if you own it in your name only you should definitely state in your will what you would like to happen to it. If you own it with somebody else such as your husband, wife, partner or friend, then it may or may not be covered in your will, it depends on how the ownership was drawn up when you bought the house. So, typically, if you're married you might own your home as something called joint tenants, and in that case, your share of the house will automatically pass to your husband or wife if you were to die. It wouldn't matter if you had a will or if your will said something different. If you owned it jointly in a different way, that wouldn't be the case. Now, in Scotland, the principle is the same, but the terminology is different. So, Clare, having a will is a good idea for most people, but how do you actually go about getting one?"}
{"question": "What resources does Royal London provide on its website regarding will drafting and what can be included in a will?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, you don't have to use a solicitor or a professional will writer to draw up a will, but many people do. Now, you'll normally have to pay a minimum of about 150 to get a solicitor to draw up a simple will for one person, but it could be more than that if your situation is very complicated if there are two of you. Now, often there are free wills months and solicitors who will draft a will for a donation to a charity or other ways of reducing the costs, so it's definitely worth watching out for these. Now, Royal London've got a guide to making a will on Royal London website and it includes how to get one made, and Royal London've also got a guide to what you can put in your will."}
{"question": "What is the name of the document provided by Royal London that helps individuals organize important information for their family?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And as I mentioned earlier on, Royal London'll include those links when Royal London send out the recording to this webinar to everyone who's registered. So, just before Royal London, Royal London finish, Royal London've mentioned you can put details into your will to make things easier for your loved ones, but it's also to have details about lots of other things in one place. So, Royal London have a document which is called, 'When I'm Gone,' and this basically goes through the kind of information that might be important to set out for your family, and you could just put all this information in one document."}
{"question": "What financial services does Royal London provide and how can it simplify administrative tasks in difficult times?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, Sarah, and I think this is a great idea. So, in my house I do all the financial stuff and I realised that my husband would have to search for paperwork if I died, I know where it all is but he doesn't. So, Royal London both filled in these forms, it's got names and phone numbers for Royal London pensions, life insurance, banks and so on, so that if the worse happened it just makes one admin job a bit easier. Now, it's also got space for things like funeral wishes. Now, you can put this in your will but things change and, and in mine, I put things like songs I would want because they mean something to me, but in a few years' time I might change my mind about that. Now, Royal London've covered a lot in the last 40 minutes or so, but Royal London do have time for a few questions now, but before Royal London go Royal London have one last poll, which is for what topic would you like us to cover in the next webinar?"}
{"question": "What are the implications for an individual's pension if they don't have a husband, wife, or civil partner according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, so please vote using the Slido link, as normal. Okay, so this is kind of-, this is one that's a fast moving poll, Royal London're getting some-, I, I, I'll, I'll come back to it right at the end just before Royal London leave because it's taking a bit of time to settle down, but I think Royal London'll take a couple of questions now. The first one is from Alexandra and, I think, Clare, you've covered this but it's really good to reiterate it. So, what if I don't have a husband, wife or civil partner? What does that mean, then, for her pension?"}
{"question": "What are the rules regarding choosing a beneficiary for a pension scheme at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, so again, it's-, you know, Royal London mentioned that there are some very old styles of pensions around where they're not quite as flexible, so it's worth checking that first of all. But now most pension schemes are quite flexible and it means you can have whoever you would like as a beneficiary. You know, they've got to be a person or a company, so a charity or a trust. I have once seen somebody try and leave their pension death benefits to a parrot and that can't happen, you can leave money to someone to look after your parrot but it's got to be a living individual or a company, but there's no other rules about who it can be, it can be friends, family, anybody."}
{"question": "Does Royal London allow policyholders in drawdown to pass on their remaining policy to their spouse without any tax implications upon their death?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yep. As you say, you can't actually leave money directly to your pets, they're, they're counted as chattels, weirdly. But I know somebody who apparently wants to leave some money to her ten hens, but there Royal London go, that didn't happen. Anyway, another question which is from Paul, saying, 'What happens if I'm in drawdown and I die? Does my wife inherit the remaining policy free of tax?'"}
{"question": "What are the implications of Paul's age when it comes to the tax status of the pension death benefits his wife receives from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, I think that's back to that question of it, it depends how old Paul is when he dies, so-, and also the fact that his wife can choose what to do with it. So, if Paul is under 75 and his wife receives the pension death benefits she can choose to take that money out, all of it out, she can take it as a cash lump sum, she can move it into drawdown and she can take a regular income or some money one year and not any money for a few years, or not take any money out. But it's really, you know, important about the age that he dies. So, if he's under 75 then that money will be income tax free, if he's over 75 then his wife would pay income tax for any money that came out of the pension. So, if she didn't take money actually out, then there wouldn't be any income tax to pay, but if she did take money out and he died at over-, 75 or over then there would be income tax to pay."}
{"question": "According to Graham's question, is it necessary to make special arrangements for the private pension to be included in the estate upon death or does it automatically become a part of the estate?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And, as you say, really good to reiterate both that age but also that it's the, the act of taking money out that triggers the income tax, not the act of having the money passed on. So, a question now from Graham, saying, 'Will my private pension automatically become part of my estate on my death or do I have to make special arrangements?' Well, in most cases, I mean, it's not really going to be part of the estate but, as Royal London said at the beginning, the pension sits outside of the estate. Anything you want to add to that, Clare?"}
{"question": "What is the general treatment of pensions in terms of estate planning according to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: No, just, you know, as Royal London said, for most pensions that's how they're set up, they're set up under discretion so they're not part of the estate. Just there are some pensions which are part of the estate, so again, it's kind of one to check, but in most situations, pensions would not be part of your estate on death. So, you can have your will and say in your will you left everything to your wife, you could have your pension leaving everything to your children, for example, so, you know, it can be different, they can be the same."}
{"question": "Can a person divide their private pension pot among multiple beneficiaries within Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yep. And there's sort of a, a related question from Annette, saying, 'If I die would my beneficiary get everything left in my private pension pot?' And I noticed you said beneficiary and, I mean, you don't need to leave your money, your pension to one person, do you? You can split it between two, three, four if you want to?"}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when deciding on the distribution of pension money within the context of Royal London's services?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yeah, that's right, you know, as I mentioned, mine's split between four people. And part of that's because, you know, my-, if I died now, I think I'm quite young, I would want my husband to remarry but I would quite like my children to keep a hold of some of my pension money because he might remarry and then if he died first then maybe his new spouse would get some of the money that he had. So, it's about, kind of, thinking longer term what you would like to happen as well. If, you know, this was in, kind of, 30 years' time maybe the chances of him remarrying again would be less. So, so it's worth thinking about things like that as well, so who would I like to receive my money, what might happen? What age am I? There's lots of different things to think about, but splitting it up amongst various beneficiaries is really common now."}
{"question": "What considerations should Robin have when contemplating leaving his pension to his eleven-year-old grandson, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And Royal London're saying that, you know, it obviously doesn't have to be a husband, or wife or child that you leave your pension to, but Royal London've got a question here from Robin, saying, 'I would like to leave my pension to my grandson who is eleven years old, anything to be aware of?' So, what could Robin-, what should Robin think about?"}
{"question": "What should be considered when planning to leave assets under the will, according to advice from a financial institution?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, that can be excellent planning because perhaps other assets under the will are going to different people and, you know, as Royal London mentioned, if you-, you can leave it to whoever you want. Royal London don't know how old Robin is, if Robin's over 75 then perhaps if you're leaving it to a grandchild then money can be taken out. Now, there would be financial advice given on their behalf as well, so say they were moved into drawdown, perhaps the money could be taken out to pay for things like school fees or, you know, when they turn eighteen, they might use some for university funding. Now, of course, just be aware that, you know, when people do reach the age of eighteen, then it's up to them what they do with the money and they could take all of the money out and spend it on whatever they wanted. But that's back to that situation over you can say who you would like to receive the benefits on your death but it's up to them to choose what happens with them, and as soon as they hit eighteen, or sixteen in Scotland, then it's their choice of how they take that money out."}
{"question": "Can relatives other than a spouse or civil partner inherit a protected pension from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, so Royal London've had a question from Silvia, which is saying, 'If I don't have a partner or husband then can my nearest relative inherit, for example, my sister or niece, can they inherit my protected pension?' Now, that's-, I started off the webinar talking about your State Pension and what happens to your State Pension when you die and the elements of that that your husband, wife or civil partner may be able to inherit, depending on the age that you reach State Pension age. Now, sadly, it's not the case that you can pass this on to another relative, it's, it's your husband, wife or civil partner who can inherit, it's not the case that other family members can inherit. But obviously, as Royal London've been discussing, with other pensions then, then you can decide who the beneficiary is. Clare, anything you want to add to that?"}
{"question": "What should individuals do in terms of informing their pension provider about death benefits, particularly in the case of marriage, according to the response provided by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay. So, Royal London've got a question now from Lily, who says, 'I'm just about to get married. Do I need to tell my pension provider for the death benefits?' I think the short answer is yes, but you'll probably want to-,"}
{"question": "What are the reasons for Lily to update her expression of wish forms or the app with Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, because it could be that Lily has lived with her partner for a number of years, so they might already be on the expression of wish forms. So, if she has already, you know, written their name down on that form or put them on the app, then the same, you know, nothing's really changed. But if Lily hasn't had that person as one of her beneficiaries and she wants to have them as a beneficiary, then it's a good idea to have a look at the form. And sometimes it's just a good idea to fill in a new form or update the app even if it's the same information you're putting, because if a significant event has happened it's sometimes just, kind of, making that point and showing that this is a recent update. Because it could be that Lily doesn't want her new husband to receive any of the death benefits, so, you know, it's kind of worth having an update to that. And even sometimes, you know, just kind of writing a bit of a story on the form or, or however you do it, to explain to the provider what you would like to happen."}
{"question": "Who would receive your defined contribution pension from Royal London if both you and your partner were to die in the same accident and you have no children?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay. Royal London've got a, a-, Royal London've got quite a few more questions but I'll try and whizz through a couple of them in the next, sort of, six or seven minutes. So, here's a question from Shaun, 'In the scenario whereby you and your partner (100% beneficiary) were to die in the same accident and you have no children, who receives your defined contribution pension on death?' And Clare, I think you covered it but it's always good to, kind of, go over this, you know, just to emphasise it again. So, what's the answer there?"}
{"question": "What did Royal London suggest about the allocation of beneficiaries in case the partner is not the sole recipient?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, it might be worth thinking about who you might want to receive benefits in the event that your partner's no longer there. So, you've said that-, Shaun said that they're a 100% beneficiary, it might be if there are nieces, nephews, friends, other people you might want to receive, you could put-, do you remember Royal London, Royal London spoke about the fact that you could have someone as, kind of, 98%, 1%, 1%, so you could have instead of 100% beneficiary being the partner you could have them as 98% beneficiary and then 1%, perhaps, for a friend and 1% for a niece or nephew. Now, again, what that's telling the company is that if the partner is alive, then you do want them to receive the benefits, but if the partner isn't alive, it means that those other beneficiaries-, well, first of all, you're giving some names of other people but it's also giving, you know, them the choice of all of the benefits you would want. So, it might be worth thinking about who else you might want to benefit if your partner was no longer alive or actually didn't want the benefits."}
{"question": "\"What strategies can be implemented to ensure tax-free transfer of a pension pot to children, specifically in Royal London's policies, considering the age 75 cut-off?\"", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, so Royal London've got a question here, a, a tax question from Kenneth, 'How do I leave my pension pot to my children without having to pay tax on what they receive?' And again, really useful to go over it-, go over again and that age 75 cut-off."}
{"question": "What circumstances would lead to income tax being payable when taking money out of a pension pot at the age of 75 or older?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, the rule is in relation to age and it is very clear that if you die when you're under 75 and it's a defined contribution pension scheme-, because remember, if it's a defined benefit then there will be income tax paid even if it's under 75, but defined contribution then there'll be no income tax payable. If you die when you're 75 or older then there will be income tax payable. Now, the way that they wouldn't pay income tax even if you died when you're over 75 is if they don't take any money out of the pot, or they could make sure that they take it within their personal allowance or, you know, they stay a basic rate taxpayer. So, again it's really crucial at these points, especially with larger pots, to take financial advice, but the, the rules on income tax are very specific about-, it's about age, so it's from 75 onwards that income tax would be payable when you take money out of that pension pot."}
{"question": "Why might a pension be liable for inheritance tax if one opts for direction over discretion when nominating beneficiaries, as suggested by Adam's question?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay. I think Royal London'll have one more question, maybe, before Royal London draw to a close. And this is from Adam, who says, 'Why would my pension be subject to inheritance tax if I chose direction instead of discretion on my nomination of beneficiaries?'"}
{"question": "Does the involvement of the pension company in making the final decision on the fate of the money break the chain and exclude it from being subject to inheritance tax, unlike any other asset that would fall under your will?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Now, it's to do with the fact that you are directly saying what's going to happen with that money, so it's just the same as if I said what was going to happen to a house, that would, you know, be subject to inheritance tax. If the pension company's making the final decision, it's breaking a chain, effectively. So, what they're doing is, although there's an expression of wish form from you saying what might happen or what you would like to happen, the company makes the final decision and that takes it out of the realm of inheritance tax. So, it's all about, kind of breaking that chain, almost, and just it's not going to be like any other asset that would be under your will which then could be subject to inheritance tax."}
{"question": "What will Royal London do with the information from the poll regarding pension options at retirement and ill health?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Great stuff. Well, thank you very much, Clare, and thank you very much for all the questions that you submitted. I'd just like to go back to the poll before Royal London close the webinar, so again, thanks to everybody who voted in the poll, I really appreciate it. So, the topic that's come out on top is pension options at retirement and on ill health, with 44%, financial advisors, what they do and how to find them was the next most popular, and then making contributions to my pension, and then finally marriage, divorce and pensions. So, Royal London'll definitely use that to inform the pensions that Royal London do-, the webinars that Royal London do, sorry, later on this year. So, thank you very much indeed for joining us, thank you, Clare, I'm glad your voice managed to hold. That is all that Royal London have time for. Thank you again for all the questions that you submitted in advance and the ones that Royal London received during the webinar. Now, as I mentioned a couple of times during the webinar, Royal London will be sharing a link with the recording of the webinar in the next few days. And that will also include links to the gov.uk website that I mentioned and also to the wills articles on rl.com, and that 'When I'm gone' document that both Clare and I spoke about. So, look out for that link but, in the meantime, a huge thank you for joining us today and for taking part in the polls and submitting questions. Thanks very much."}
{"question": "What topics were covered by Clare Moffat and Sarah Pennells during the recorded session by a finance company?", "answer": "Listen to Royal London pension experts Clare Moffat and Sarah Pennells as they cover some pension basics, find out where your money is invested and how you can be making the most of your pension. This session was recorded on 7 March 2023."}
{"question": "What topics will be covered in today's webinar by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And I'm Sarah Pennells and I'm the Consumer Finance Specialist here at Royal London. And in today's webinar Royal London're going to be talking about how to make the most of your pension. So Royal London'll start with a quick recap of the basics of what a pension is. Royal London'll talk about how much to save in your pension and importantly how your pension can save you tax. Now, Royal London had a staggering 546 questions submitted ahead of this webinar so, first of all, a huge thank you if you did submit a question. But obviously Royal London're not going to be able to answer all of them in the next 45 minutes or so. Now, Clare and I would like nothing better than to talk about pensions non-stop for two days, but you may have other things to do."}
{"question": "What are the guidelines for asking questions during the Royal London webinar?", "answer": "Now Royal London have read every question, and what Royal London're going to do is answer some of the most popular questions in this webinar, but Royal London would still like you to submit some questions and I can see some of you already have been. Royal London have left some time at the end to answer questions that come in. As with all of Royal London webinars, though, Royal London can't answer your specific circumstances and Royal London can't talk about a Royal London policy. So if you have a comment or a question, please make it using the Slido app or link now. One more announcement to make which is that a reminder that Royal London are recording this webinar and Royal London will be sharing a link to the recording with everybody who registered in the next day or so."}
{"question": "What distinguishes a pension from other savings or investment plans, with respect to Royal London's definition?", "answer": "So let's start with the basics, Clare, let's get on with it. What is a pension? And by that I mean what makes something a pension rather than a different kind of savings or investment plan?"}
{"question": "What is the current age requirement for individuals to withdraw money from their pension with respect to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, it's a really good question. The purpose of a pension is to provide money when you've stopped working or perhaps before this, but you must be 55 or over currently to be able to take out any money from your pension. Now that age is rising to 57 by April 2028. Now a pension is different to other types of savings or investments plans because of the way it's taxed. Now Royal London'll be talking about how pensions can save you tax later on, but in broad terms the government gives you a tax top up on the money you save into your pension, and you're allowed to take out some money tax free. Now under the rules you can only take money out of your pension before the age of 55 in very limited circumstances. So normally if you're very ill or perhaps in certain specified jobs where you are allowed to retire early."}
{"question": "What information should Royal London provide about the two distinct types of pensions?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So that's what a pension is but I suppose Royal London should explain about the two different types of pension as well."}
{"question": "What are some types of defined benefit pensions and how do they compare to receiving a monthly salary from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, you might have heard the words, 'Defined benefit.' Now that's the type of pension that makes a promise to pay you a regular payment for the rest of your life. Now that would start when you stop working. A final salary pension is one type of defined benefit pension but there are other types as well. You might have heard of, 'Career average,' as well. Now if you retire and you have a defined benefit pension, well it's almost like carrying on getting your monthly salary, except you'll get less, of course. And you can take some tax-free cash too. Also, if you have a husband or a wife who is alive longer than you, then that payment will normally carry on for their lives too. Now these days you're more likely to see defined benefit pensions in the public sector, although lots of people have some definite benefit pensions from the past."}
{"question": "What type of pension does Royal London offer, where individuals or employers can build up a pot of money and use it for retirement income, with the option to withdraw funds before retirement?", "answer": "The second type of pension is called a defined contribution pension. So that's the type of pension that pension providers offer to you individually or through your job. Now these are pensions where you build up a pot of money and then you use that money to give you an income to live on when you retire but you can take out some money before you stop working if you want to."}
{"question": "What type of pension or pensions do you have, according to the information provided by Sarah Pennells, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now you may have noticed that Royal London haven't mentioned the State Pension and there's a very good reason for that. That's because in Royal London last webinar in December Royal London spent almost an hour talking about and answering your questions on the State Pension so there's a link to that webinar on this page. Now before Royal London go any further I think it's time for Royal London first poll. So, what Royal London'd like to do is ask about the type of pension or pensions that you have. Whether you've got defined benefit pension or pensions, defined contribution, a mix, or you're not sure. So please vote using Slido."}
{"question": "What percentage of people are uncertain about their pension type and how does Royal London address this issue?", "answer": "Okay so at the moment, Clare, 'Not sure,' is actually the most popular answer, so 36-, it's changing as I'm speaking but 36, 35% saying not sure. About a similar number, 32% is saying defined contribution and about 27% saying both. Only 4% defined benefits so-, I mean I think it's interesting that so many people aren't quite sure what kind of pension or pensions they have. Maybe not that surprising because many people may have had pensions over a number of years and may not have actually checked for a while."}
{"question": "What is Royal London mainly focused on in relation to pension schemes?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And that's right, especially if you've left an employer. You might remember who you've worked for, you probably will remember who you've worked for, but you might not remember the type of pension scheme that you had and it's probably only as you get closer to retirement you think about that a little bit more. And, you know, Royal London will still see people that do have a mixture of both. In years to come that won't be as common, but you know, it is more common now. Now of course the reason Royal London asked this question, well it's because Royal London are going be mainly focused on defined contribution pensions and some of the key features in relation to them, rather than defined benefits. One of the key features with a defined contribution pension is that you're in control of how your pension contributions are invested. But there's a lot of confusion about what exactly happens to your pension money and it's something Royal London had a lot of questions about."}
{"question": "How does an individual find out where their money is invested if they have just joined their employer's pension scheme at Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, Royal London absolutely did. Including this question from Philip, who says he's just joined his employers pension scheme and how does he find out where his money is invested? Now Royal London will answer your question, Philip, but I think before Royal London do that Royal London'll do a quick explainer of what happens to your pension money. So, the money that you pay into your pension and money that comes from your employer into your pension, if you're in a workplace pension scheme, together with the government tax top up of tax relief, that's all invested, all invested into-, in funds. And these funds in turn invest in different assets. So they may buy the shares of a range of companies for example, or they may buy company bonds which effectively means loaning the company's money. Or government bonds if they're buying them from the UK government, they're called gilts. Or other assets including things like commercial property. If you're in a workplace pension-, and this is a really important point, unless you actively decide where your pension money is invested, then it will be put into something that is called the default fund."}
{"question": "What is the objective of the default fund in workplace pension schemes at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, the make up of these default funds-, well it varies from one pension scheme to another. But the idea is that it meets the needs of most of the members of the workplace pension scheme. Now the vast majority of workplace pension scheme members have their money invested in the default fund. So if you're happy to have your money there then you don't need to do anything at all. But you don't have to keep your money in the default fund."}
{"question": "What should one consider when deciding to switch their pension money within their workplace pension in terms of risk, especially when evaluating the funds one wants to move their money to, relative to the current risk associated with Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: No, that's absolutely right. So, you can switch money that's in your pension to other funds within your workplace pension if you prefer and you can choose those funds. So that's something that you can do yourself and switch some or all of your money. Now if you want to switch funds within your workplace pension, then you won't normally be charged if you're doing this. I think it's really important, though, to think about if you want to switch your pension money, about the risk that you might be taking in terms of the funds that you might want to move your money too, compared to the risk that might be associated with where your money is at the moment. And I think that risk is one of those things that-, it can be quite tricky to talk about when Royal London're thinking about it in relation to money. How much risk someone might be comfortable taking."}
{"question": "What kind of advice does Royal London provide on finding a financial adviser?", "answer": "Now the idea behind taking more risk, putting your money into a riskier fund, is that you have the potential for higher growth, but you do also have the risk that there's a higher chance that your pension will lose money as well. So, there's that thing around the comfort level that you have about the risk that fund or funds might be taking, but it's also important to think about how far away you are from retirement when you might want to access your money. Because that could also affect the amount of risk that you're actually able to take. And this is why it's an important decision and it's a really good idea to talk to a financial adviser, this is something they can really help you to think through and talk through. Now Royal London do know that not everybody has a financial adviser so Royal London've got an article on Royal London website about how to find a financial adviser. It talks about the, kind of, different questions you might need to ask or think about in your own mind and also some adviser directories."}
{"question": "What resources are available on the government-backed MoneyHelper website regarding pensions and investment funds in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Royal London've also got information on Royal London websites about pensions and investment funds, but there's also an article on the MoneyHelper website which is government backed website about pensions and investment funds and the address of that website moneyhelper.org.uk"}
{"question": "What are the different ways to find out where your pension money is invested in Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, there are three different ways that you can find out where your pension money is invested. So, first of all your annual pension statement so, you know, the statements get sent once a year as the name implies, and they have information about how much you've paid into your pension, how much your pension is worth but also where it's invested, the different fund or funds that your pension money is invested in. So that's a good place to look. Now if your pension provider has an app then they may list the funds that your pension money is invested in and that can be really hand if you're the kind of person who wants to check on your pension you can do it, obviously, whenever you want to. But also if your pension has an online portal then you can login there and, again, as well as your contribution details, it will have information about the investment funds that your pension money is in."}
{"question": "Can Royal London determine if you are aware of the amount you are saving into your pension every month?", "answer": "Right time for another poll, I think. So, this time-, Royal London've asked you about the kind of pension or pensions that you may have, this time Royal London'd like you to tell us whether you know how much you're saving into your pension each month. So please vote now."}
{"question": "What is the perception of Royal London regarding the current savings habits and knowledge level of individuals surveyed?", "answer": "Okay this is really interesting, so Royal London're getting at the moment about half and half of people saying they know to the penny, and people who are saying they have a rough idea. About one in ten, nine percent, are currently saying, 'Not a clue,' and about five percent are saying they're not currently saving into a pension. Is this what you expected, Clare? What do you take from these results?"}
{"question": "What is the recommended amount of money that people should aim to pay into their pension according to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, because I think some people will know the fixed amount that's going in, but some people might-, it's a-, it might be a percentage. So, and especially if you've got, kind of, fluctuating salary, perhaps. You know, different salary every month then there could be a different amount going into your pension every month, but it's really encouraging to see that people-, you know, a lot of people do have a rough idea as well as people, kind of, know to the penny as well. And you know, as you say it's really interesting because even if you do know exactly how much you're saving into your pension every month, you might not know whether that's enough for retirement. And that's something Royal London had a lot of questions about, including one from Anthony who asked how much he should be paying into his pension so that he has enough to live on. Now Sarah, Royal London know money is really tight for a lot of people at the moment, so how much should people aim to pay into their pension?"}
{"question": "What are some factors to consider when thinking about the amount to save into your pension, considering the type of life you want to live in retirement, according to Sarah Pennells from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: It's a really good question from Anthony, and as you said, Royal London had some others who also submitted a very similar question, so thanks for that. And there isn't an answer, unfortunately, in a way, of one, sort of, single figure of, 'This many pounds a month.' I think if you are thinking about how much to save into your pension, then it is really helpful to think about your end destination. So, in this case, think about retirement, think about the kind of life that you'd live in retirement and really think about it in some detail. So how will you spend your time when you're not working, or when you're not working so much? Are you the kind of person who wants to travel a lot? Do you want to travel to far flung places? Or are you somebody, 'That just isn't important to you'? Do you want to take up some new and possibly expensive hobbies, or are you happy with your existing possibly expensive, possibly not, have-, hobbies? How do you imagine spending your time? A really big important expense is your mortgage or rent."}
{"question": "What are the potential financial implications for individuals retiring with a mortgage, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Will you still have a mortgage when you retire? If so, what's that likely to be? How many years will you have that for? If you're renting, likewise. Is your rent going to be similar to now? Could it be less? Is it going to be more? Even if you don't have a mortgage, if you're going to be retiring and your mortgage will be fully paid off, is your home the kind of property that could be a money pit in terms of repairs and improvements. Or even if it's not the case, are you the kind of person who likes to redecorate regularly and spend money on your property or does that really leave you cold?"}
{"question": "What are the benefits of retirement according to the Royal London paragraph?", "answer": "The next stage is to think about when you retire. And again, I think it can be helpful to shift how you think about stopping work, because I talk to lots of people who say, 'You know, I really love my job, I don't really want to retire until I'm in my late 60s, even 70s.' But sadly not everybody is going to be able to carry on working until their late 60s or 70s, even if they want to. And retirement isn't just about, 'This is the life you have after you decide that you have to stop work,' retirement enables you to have a life without having to work to pay the bills. You can stop work if you want to, or you can carry on working, it's up to you. But what retirement enables you to do, is to not have to work to pay those bills."}
{"question": "What is the State Pension amount offered by Royal London in comparison to the new State Pension rate from April?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, that's a really good point. And in that case I think the starting point is to look at what you'd have to live on if you didn't have any pension at all. So that's going to be the State Pension and once you know what the State Pension will pay you, then I think you can work out whether that's enough to give you the kind of life you'd like in retirement or whether you're going to have to have more into your pension to give you a good standard of living in retirement. So, let's talk about the new State Pension. That is currently 9,660 a year, per person if you have a full National Insurance record. And that's gonna rise to 10,636 from April the 6th. Now, that works out at 805 a month, currently, or 886 a month from April. Now, if you joined the State Pension webinar, you will know that I tried to live on the State Pension for a week last year, along with some of Royal London customers. I took the State Pension challenge. And I have to be honest and say I didn't find it easy. Apart from having to watch my spending even more closely than I currently do, I realised that there was just no stack in the system, certainly for me, and that was quite stressful."}
{"question": "How can individuals plan their finances at Royal London considering the increasing State Pension age and the need for additional savings beyond the State Pension amount?", "answer": "And I did the challenge in summer, when I didn't have the same, kind of, you know, heating and winter bills that Royal London're all facing at the moment. But even if you are happy to live on the State Pension amount on its own, or largely on its own, then there's a question about whether you're happy to wait until the earliest age at which you can get your State Pension before you stop work. So, currently, the State Pension age is 66. So, that's when you can get your State Pension. But it's rising to 67 and is, by 2028, and is due to rise to 68 later on. So, the two questions that follow up from that, how much more do you want to have saved in the State Pension amount? And how much earlier do you want to retire than the State Pension age, and when you're allowed to claim your State Pension?"}
{"question": "What factors should individuals consider when planning their retirement, keeping in mind their desired lifestyle, in context of a finance company like Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And should people be focusing on the age they want to retire or the type of lifestyle that they'd like to live?"}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when determining how much to save for retirement, including expenses like mortgage or rent?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, I, I'd personally say both. I mean, I think if, if you're the kind of person who wants to have a really comfortable lifestyle, you know, you want to travel a lot, you want to eat out, you want to, maybe, leave money for your children or grandchildren, then that's going to have a really big impact on how much you need to save for your retirement, compared to somebody who doesn't have those, doesn't really want to live like that. But, obviously, it will also be affected by when you want to retire. You know, whether you want to retire at 55 or at State Pension age. Obviously, as I mentioned, one of the biggest expenses is going to be your mortgage or rent. So, that's going to be a, a huge one to factor in. So, I think it's maybe time for another poll, Clare."}
{"question": "What are some common expectations or desires for a good retirement, according to Royal London's observations?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes. Royal London've been talking about how to think about what you might need in retirement. So, let's think about that in a little bit more detail. So, if you were thinking about your life and retirement now, which of these is the closest to how you imagine it? Now, obviously, everyone's got very different ideas, but try and pick an answer that's closest to what you think a good retirement looks like. Okay. So, lots of people want three weeks' holiday in Europe and replacing their car every five years. So, I'm not surprised by that. Are you, Sarah?"}
{"question": "What are some factors that influence people's decisions regarding their retirement savings, according to Sarah Pennells from a finance company?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: No. I think Royal London've-, this is a really interesting one because I think when you ask people to think about their retirement and you give them a choice, which is, kind of, basically, not being able to spend so much money on food, not being able to spend so much money on clothes, on, on birthday presents, on, you know, whatever it is, and, and not much on holidays or transport, not surprisingly, people do go for the more, sort of, comfortable end, in terms of retirement. But, yes, so it's settled on 50% at the moment saying, you know, basically, 'I'd like this three weeks' holiday in Europe and replacing my car.' About four in ten, though, are saying, 'Actually, I'd be quite happy with two weeks' holiday in Europe and I'm not so bothered about replacing my car that frequently.'"}
{"question": "What is the reason for Royal London asking about car ownership and holiday plans in the UK?", "answer": "Only 4%, so fewer than one in twenty are saying, 'No car and holidaying in the UK.' And it's-, the reason Royal London ask this is that there's a really useful website called retirementlivingstandards.org.uk which Royal London've added the link to, and that website will really tell you how much you need, as an annual income, depending on the kind of-, kind of retirement that you'd like. So, it's based on independent research, and if you go to the website you'll see, next to each different income level, what that will buy you. And I think it's important to say that the numbers on the retirement living standards presume, first of all, that you don't have any housing expenses at all."}
{"question": "What percentage of individuals, according to Royal London's poll, claimed to be satisfied with the minimum lifestyle standard of living?", "answer": "So, no mortgage or rent. And they presume that any money you have from your pension is, has been, the tax has been paid, and any money that's coming out of your pension. Now, if you're happy with what they call a minimum lifestyle standard of living, and Royal London found that only 4% of people in Royal London poll were, but if you live on your own, then you'll need 12,800 a year. And to give you a bit more of an idea of what that includes, you'll be able to have a weekend and weeks' break in the UK every year. Spend about 54 a week on food, and up to 60 a month on clothes and shoes. But as Royal London've said in the poll, you wouldn't be able to run a car."}
{"question": "What is the recommended annual income for a single person to have a comfortable lifestyle, including the ability to replace the kitchen or bathroom in their home every ten or fifteen years, along with three weeks' holiday in Europe and other expenses?", "answer": "Now, for a moderate lifestyle, you'll need an income of 23,300 a year for a single person. For that, you'd spend a bit more on food. 74 a week. 65 a month on clothes and shoes. Go on holiday to Europe for two weeks of the year. And if you want the comfortable lifestyle, and Royal London've found that about half of you said, 'Yes, please.' Then you'd need an income of 37,300 a year for a single person. And, as well as the car that Royal London mentioned, three weeks' holiday in Europe, but also, you can afford, as well as spending more money on things like food, and clothes, and birthday presents, you'd be able to replace your kitchen or bathroom in your home every ten or fifteen years."}
{"question": "What kind of tangible examples can the retirement living standards website provide to bring to life retirement at different income levels, as stated by the finance company mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "Now, I do think this is one thing that's really, really good about the retirement living standards website because you can just go through and look at, actually, what you'd like. And they're very, sort of, tangible examples. And I think it really does help to bring to life what retirement at different income levels could look like."}
{"question": "What factors does the pension calculator on the MoneyHelper website consider when determining the required savings for a comfortable retirement income?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And if you're part of a couple, those figures rise, but they don't double. And that's because it's cheaper for two people living together than for two people living on their own. So, for a moderate lifestyle, instead of 23,300 pounds a year, you'd need 34,000 for a couple. And you can see on screen there the number for minimum and comfortable too. Now, you might be wondering how much you need to save to get to those amounts, and, and that depends on a lot of factors. There's a really handy pension calculator on the MoneyHelper website that Sarah mentioned earlier. And it looks at, for income retirement, but then looks at your salary now, pension contributions that you're making, your employer's making, what your State Pension age will be. And it works out if you'd have a shortfall."}
{"question": "What considerations should individuals who are facing challenges with the cost of living and contemplating reducing or stopping their pension contributions contemplate, particularly if they are planning to retire at 65?", "answer": "So, you plug in the numbers. You'd like to retire at 65, for example, and it helps you, kind of, work out if that's achievable or what you would need to do to help that. But Sarah, Royal London know that some people are really struggling with the cost of living, so they might be thinking about stopping or reducing their pension contributions. So, so, what should they think about?"}
{"question": "What are some reasons for not reducing pension contributions, especially for those who are employed and have a workplace pension like Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, you know, you might expect someone from a pension company to say, 'Don't think about stopping or reducing your pension contributions.' And, on one level, that, sort of, is what I'm going to say and, and the reason is that I think the first reason is that Royal London know most people don't save enough money for their retirement. Now, that's not a judgement. That's just what the research shows us. So, they don't save enough for the, kind of, you know, a good standard of living when they stop work. The second reason, though, is that if you're employed, then you're in a work, and you're in a workplace pension, then, that means you'll be giving up your employers' contributions into your pension."}
{"question": "What type of contributions does Royal London offer for employees' pensions?", "answer": "But also, tax relief, the tax top-up from the government as well. Now, Royal London know that some employers, quite a number of them, won't just contribute on a, kind of, standard level or basis. They will do something that's called matching or matched contributions. And this means if you want to pay more into your pension, they will match the, the money that you pay in. Now, obviously, I'm very aware Royal London're in the middle of a cost of living crisis, and Royal London know that millions of people are really struggling with day-to-day bills. So, this may be not the time you're thinking of paying more money into your pension. But it is worth checking with your employer for, you know, when those bills do start to come down and you may find that you have some spare money because, as I've said, they well match your contributions."}
{"question": "What are the details of tax relief and how does it work for Royal London?", "answer": "Now, if you are struggling to pay your household bills, then it definitely could make sense to reduce or pause your pension contributions. I did mention, there, that one of the reasons not to stop paying into your pension is the employer contributions but also the tax relief. And Royal London got a lot of questions about tax relief, including ones from Laura and Richard and they want to know, 'What is tax relief? How does it work?' So, Clare, what's the answer in more detail?"}
{"question": "What is the principle of tax relief and how does it work for pension schemes at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay. So, let's have a look on screen about how, how tax relief works. Now, it's worth seeing, at the outset, that the principle of tax relief is the same across different types of pension schemes. But the way it works in practice can vary. Now, if you pay 80 into your pension, and you're a basic rate taxpayer, then the government will top that up by 20. So, 100 will go into your pension. Now, if you're a higher or additional rate taxpayer, then you'll get extra tax relief. So, an extra 20 and an extra 25. You'll get at the higher rate of tax, and so, that brings the tax relief. You can see the example for a higher rate taxpayer there."}
{"question": "What is the procedure to claim extra tax relief for higher or additional rate taxpayers in an individual pension or workplace scheme?", "answer": "But, and, you know, this is an important point to make, you may either get that extra tax relief, so that extra if you're a higher or additional rate taxpayer automatically, or you might have to claim it back from HMRC. So, if you're paying into an individual pension or, or some types of workplace scheme, then you'll get that same 20% or 25% tax relief. Sorry, same 20% basic rate tax relief, but you'll have to claim that extra twenty or 25% from HMRC. Now, you can do this in a tax return, if you fill one in, or you can phone them up. Don't miss out on money in doing this, and lots of people do miss out on this."}
{"question": "What are some schemes that employers might operate, such as salary exchange or salary sacrifice, and how does it relate to Royal London?", "answer": "So, it's one to be aware of. However, some employers operate slightly differently. So, if they operate a scheme called salary exchange, or sometimes called a salary sacrifice, and Royal London're going to come back to this a little bit later on about how that works. Now, your pension contributions are taken off your salary before tax is paid. Now, in that situation, or if it's a type of pension like a, a public sector pension scheme, or another type of scheme where it's also taken off before tax, then if you're a higher or additional rate taxpayer, you don't need to claim anything back because you're getting the benefit of the full amount of tax relief immediately."}
{"question": "What is the process for receiving tax relief and employer contributions in a workplace pension scheme like Royal London if you are a higher or additional rate taxpayer, and how does it differ from other investments such as ISAs?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, I think the message there is if you are a higher or additional rate taxpayer, then it's important to check if you do have to do something to get all that tax relief back or you might be losing out. Now, if you're in a workplace pension scheme, then your employer has to pay something into your pension as well. So, you have the benefit of the tax relief and that money from your employer. But Clare, one of the other features of a pension is that there are limits on how much you can pay into it each year. Now, pensions aren't the only kind of investment that have these annual limits, you know, ISAs do as well, for example. But how does it work if you have a pension?"}
{"question": "What is the maximum lump sum that Michelle can pay into her pension at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes. And Royal London've had lots of questions on this as well, including from Michelle who asks, what's the maximum lump sum she can pay in. So, for most people who are employees, the maximum that they can pay into their pension and get that government top-up tax relief is their earnings. So, if you earn 20,000 a year, then, theoretically, the most that you could pay in and get tax relief is 20,000 a year. But if someone isn't working then they can still pay 2,880 a year into a pension, and they'll get a 20% top-up as well. So, that means they would have 3,600 going into a pension."}
{"question": "What features might an app from a finance company offer, such as Royal London, to help users track their tax relief on pension contributions made through salary sacrifice or exchange schemes?", "answer": "Now, anyone can have a pension, even children. Your pension provider might have an app that shows you the amount of tax relief that you're getting from the government, and that's interesting to look at, but one thing to mention is that if it's a salary sacrifice or a salary exchange scheme, it might not be as obvious to see on an app, but you are still getting the benefit of the tax relief because you're not paying tax on that money."}
{"question": "What is the impact of the tax rates in Scotland for higher rate taxpayers in terms of tax relief provided by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes. There are different rates of tax in Scotland, so you might be paying more tax than in the rest of the UK. Now, if you're a higher rate or an additional rate taxpayer, then these tax rates are increasing, again, on the 6th of April this year by 1%. However, the more tax you pay, the more relief you get. So, that actually means more money in your pension. So, in Scotland, if you're a higher rate taxpayer, you, you will be paying 42%, but instead of getting 40% tax relief, you'll be getting 42% tax relief."}
{"question": "Can you explain how salary exchange works at Royal London and why it's referred to as salary sacrifice or salary exchange?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, Clare, you mentioned salary sacrifice a moment ago. And again, Royal London had quite a few questions on this, including one from Kate, who wants to know, 'Is salary sacrifice something that's always offered?' I think before Royal London answer that, well, just to explain a wee bit more about salary sacrifice. Now you, you described it as salary sacrifice or salary exchange. It's, it's known as both of those things. And, in a way, salary exchange is a-, is a better description because what you do is you give up, essentially, or exchange a percentage of your salary and that money is then paid into your pension by your employer. They pay that money into your pension on your behalf."}
{"question": "Can switching to a salary sacrifice with Royal London potentially increase the amount of money going into your pension?", "answer": "So, you're not actually sacrificing it because you are exchanging it for something in return. Now, doing it this way means that you can save National Insurance which is, of course, just another tax. And that means more money can go into your pension. So, you know, you could either, if you switched into a salary sacrifice, you could either carry on saying, putting in the same amount into your pension, which actually means more money would go into your pension, or, and if you could prefer, you could set it up so the same goes into your pension, and in that case, you'll end up with slightly more take-home pay."}
{"question": "What circumstances should be considered before using salary sacrifice, and can Royal London inform employees about when it may not be advisable?", "answer": "Now, using salary sacrifice means that there would have to be a change to your employment contact, and there are some circumstances where salary sacrifice can't be used, or isn't a good idea. So, for example, you can't use salary sacrifice if it means that your wages will be taken below the minimum wage. Now, for the majority of people, though, salary sacrifice is definitely worth considering. But if your employer offers this, then they'll be able to let you know the circumstances where it's not a good idea. Now, if you receive a bonus through your work, then you can use bonus exchange, if your employer offers that, and that works in the same way."}
{"question": "What is the importance of salary sacrifice benefits to employers, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "So, kind of, back to Kate's original question which is, 'Is this something that's offered everywhere?' The answer is no. It's not necessarily something that all employers offer, although a number of them do. But there are tax advantages for employers as well. So, if your employer doesn't offer salary sacrifice, it's definitely worth asking if they consider it."}
{"question": "What should individuals consider when moving overseas and wanting to transfer their pension funds, including tax relief and employer contributions, to a qualifying recognized overseas pension, keeping in mind the involvement of different jurisdictions and potential tax implications in different countries?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, Royal London've had a question from Ioli and a couple of other people about moving overseas. Now, the question asked was, 'If I leave the country and don't come back, can I get my pension money back?' Well, the whole pension, including any tax relief and employer contribution can usually be moved to something called a qualifying recognised overseas pension. Now, that's a pension in another country which HMRC feels operates in a similar way. Now, you can sometimes leave your pension here and your pension could be paid to an overseas bank account, but you know, in both of these situations, I would say that financial advice is key because you're dealing with different jurisdictions and there are different tax issues in different countries."}
{"question": "Can individuals contribute their entire salary into their pension with Royal London, provided they can afford to do so?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, Clare, Royal London just talked a bit about how much you can pay into your pension in relation to your salary, but if you're in the fortunate position of earning say, you know, 100,000 a year, 50,000, whatever it is. Could you pay all of that into your pension, assuming that you could afford to?"}
{"question": "What is the difference between the annual allowance and the maximum pension contributions as discussed by a finance company?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, in theory yes, but there might be some tax consequences of doing that. So, so, let's talk about something called the annual allowance. Now, the first thing to say is that the annual allowance will not impact most people in the UK, but it's worth explaining how it works because it is being mentioned in the press a lot just now. Now, the annual allowance is a limit on how much money can go into your pension in any one tax year, without paying a tax charge. It's not the maximum pension contributions that you can make, which, which Royal London spoke about earlier and it's really easy to confuse these two situations."}
{"question": "What is the significance of carry forward in relation to the annual allowance and pensions at Royal London?", "answer": "You could still pay more than the annual allowance if you have those earnings to support it, but you would have to be taxed for the amount over the annual allowance. And the annual allowance is currently 40,000 for most people. So, in that example of someone earning 100,000 for example, they'd be able to pay 40,000 of their salary into their pension, in the current tax year without a tax charge, but there is tax concession, and you'll see on the right of the screen there. There's something called carry forward. Now, you can use this if you ever had any amount in a pension. So, you just need to have had even 20 in a stakeholder pension years ago to be able to use carry forward."}
{"question": "What financial advice is key for understanding carry forward and where can I find more information about it if I want to know how it works?", "answer": "Now, this means if you haven't used your annual allowance from the three years before the current year, then you can carry that forward. But this is only relevant if you can make them large contributions into your pension and you have the earnings to match that mount of pension contribution that you want to make. Now, again, financial advice is key to help with carry forward, it's quite complicated. If you want to find out, you know, more information about how carry forward works, again, there's a really helpful article about it on the MoneyHelper website."}
{"question": "What is the role of Royal London in the measurement of pensions savings against the annual allowance for defined contribution pensions?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And it's important to say as well, that how pensions saving are measured against the annual allowance depends on the, kind of, pension scheme that you're in. So, for defined contribution pensions, which Royal London've been talking about, where you and if you're employed, your employer build up a pot of money and based on your own contributions, plus of course, that tax relief. Any employer contributions and any contributions made on your behalf by someone else, all count towards that allowance."}
{"question": "What factors need to be considered when calculating the annual allowance for defined benefit pensions?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: For defined benefit pensions, it's not quite as easy as that. So, that's-, so it's mainly public sector pensions now and where you're guaranteed that certain amount in retirement, which is linked to the salary you earned when you're employed. Now, in that situation, your annual allowance is based on the increase in your pension benefits over the tax year. So, that can be quite tricky to work out because it's just-, it's not as easy knowing 20,000 went into your pension fund."}
{"question": "What steps should be taken to obtain financial advice regarding the annual allowance tax charge for pension schemes at Royal London?", "answer": "Now, your pension scheme can explain more about this, and they'll tell you how much you've used. Again, if you think that the annual allowance affects you, the best thing to do is to take financial advice and it's really important to say, that an annual allowance tax charge it doesn't necessarily mean that you should stop paying into your pension, you can actually end up better off in retirement, even if you have had an annual allowance tax charge. But an adviser will help you work all of this out."}
{"question": "Is the tapered annual allowance mentioned by Royal London the same as the regular annual allowance?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: I realise that Royal London're throwing a lot of terminology around, but I have heard of one, something called tapered annual allowance. So, is that the same as the annual allowance?"}
{"question": "How does the tapered annual allowance from Royal London differ from the annual allowance?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: I think the confusing is that lots of these terms sound quite similar. So, the tapered annual allowance is not quite the same as the annual allowance. Now, this affects even fewer people than it did a few years ago and it reduces that annual allowance from that 40,000 mark, gradually, sort of, tapering down until it could reduce to 4,000. Now, it all depends on how much you earn. There's a two part test, but essentially this is only going to affect you if you have income over 200,000 after your pension contributions have been deducted."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the money purchase annual allowance mentioned by Royal London and how does it differ from other allowances in relation to pension withdrawals?", "answer": "Again, getting advice on this, you know, if it is something that you think might impact you is really important. Okay, so, there's one more allowance though that Royal London should mention. And again, it sounds quite similar. Royal London've saved this one until the end because this allowance, now it's called the money purchase annual allowance is unlike the other allowances Royal London've discussed because it's only going to affect you when you take money out of your pension, not when you pay money in. So, Sarah, can you tell us a little bit more about the money purchase annual allowance?"}
{"question": "Is Royal London discussing the potential impact of taking money out of pensions in this webinar?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, absolutely. And Royal London arent speaking in detail in this webinar are about what happens if you take money out of your pensions because frankly, Royal London just don't have time today, but it is worth talking about the money purchase annual allowance for the reasons Clare mentioned. It's been in the news recently and there have even been some rumours that it may be disappearing in next week's budget, so it's good to mention it. And it is something that can potentially affect a lot of people."}
{"question": "How does the money purchase annual allowance impact individuals who withdraw funds flexibly from their defined contribution pension pot and later wish to make contributions to a pension, specifically in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "So, the money purchase annual allowance may affect you if you start to take money flexibly out of your defined contribution pension pot and later, want to contribute to a pension and it does this by dramatically reducing the amount of money that you can pay into your pension every year, without having to pay a tax charge. Now, taking money flexibly includes, taking an income, or maybe taking a series of lump sums from your pension, but it doesn't include taking the tax free cash out of your pension, or using your pension to buy a regular income in the form of an annuity."}
{"question": "What is the impact of triggering the money purchase annual allowance on the maximum amount that can be paid into a pension at Royal London?", "answer": "So, let's talk about this more and explain it with some figures. Royal London've said that the annual allowance is 40,000, but if you trigger the money purchase annual allowance then the amount that can be paid into your pension drops right down to 4,000. So, for example, you know, you might have stopped work and, you know, retired and started to take a bit out of money out of your pension, on top of that tax free cash lump sum. And then realised that actually, either you miss work or the cost of living crisis, for example, means you have to go back to work. And then when you're back in work, you'd only be able to contribute 4,000 a year into your defined contribution pensions."}
{"question": "What are the situations in which the money purchase annual allowance does not apply, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Now, 4,000, that's about 333 a month, but as I mentioned earlier, that 4,000 limit includes any contributions you make, any contributions your employer makes, if you're in a workplace scheme and the tax relief. And Royal London are seeing more and more people going back into work as a result of the cost of living crisis when they had retired. So, I think having explained when it does apply, Clare, when doesn't the money purchase annual allowance apply?"}
{"question": "What types of pensions are exempt from the money purchase annual allowance mentioned by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, it doesn't apply if you take money out of a defined benefit pension. So, those public sector pensions Royal London mentioned. So, say I was a nurse, so, if I retired at 55 and took my tax free cash and pension income, but then decided a few years later that I wanted to do a totally different job and I went to work in a shop. The money purchase annual allowance doesn't apply to me and that's because it's not flexible access, it's from a defined benefit pension. And in a similar way, it doesn't apply if you take tax free cash and buying an annuity which isn't flexible."}
{"question": "How does Royal London handle individuals reaching the age of 55 who wish to access a portion of their tax-free cash and transition the remaining funds into drawdown without triggering the money purchase annual allowance?", "answer": "It also doesn't apply if you only take your tax free cash and then move the rest of your pension money into drawdown, but don't take any income from that drawdown. So, that might be because you're still working. So, Royal London would often see people reach the age of 55 and want to access some of their tax free cash and move the rest into drawdown. So, they will not trigger the money purchase annual allowance. So, just to put some numbers around it. If I have a 100,000 in my pension pot, take 25,000 tax free cash and move the rest into drawdown, but don't touch it, probably because I'm still working, my annual allowance will still stay at 40,000. And it also doesn't apply if you take up to three small pensions of less than 10,000."}
{"question": "What are the eligibility criteria for applying the Royal London policies if someone has moved their pension pot into drawdown and starts taking income or a cash lump sum?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, it will apply if you've moved that pension pot into drawdown and start to even take 1 of income. So, probably when you've stopped working, that you need some income to live on. It'll also apply if you take any amount of a cash lump sum. Now, cash lump sums are those payments where 25% is taxed at 0 but the other 75% is taxable, both those payments come into your bank account at the same time. So, you'll get the tax free part and the taxable part."}
{"question": "What is the most commonly asked question about consolidating multiple pensions from different jobs, as discussed in a Royal London webinar?", "answer": "Now, if I even took 100 of one of these cash lump sums, then I trigger the money purchase annual allowance. Before Royal London hand over questions that have come in during the webinar, there's one question that many people submitted, in fact, it was one of the most asked questions. Eleanor was just one person who asked it. Now, that question is, 'I have multiple pensions from different jobs, should I consolidate them?' And again, Sarah, this is another topic that Royal London did a webinar on."}
{"question": "What are the pros and cons of pension transfers according to the webinar conducted by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: That's right. So, Royal London did a webinar on pensions transfers or pension consolidation last summer and there's the link to that on this page. I think though, having said that, it is worth spending a bit of time just talking about some of the pros and cons of transferring. Before Royal London do that though, I think it's also worth saying, when you can't transfer a pension. So, you can't transfer a pension if you're in a public sector scheme, such as the NHS, teachers, police or fire fighters and that's because the money that you pay into your pension today, goes out to pay today's pensioners. So, there's no actual fund for you to transfer out of."}
{"question": "What are the main pros and cons of transferring or consolidating multiple defined contribution pensions, specifically for someone like Clare who has public sector pensions and is associated with a particular finance company?", "answer": "The only exception in terms of public sector pensions is the local government pension scheme, which does have a fund. So, in theory, you could transfer it, but it is generally assumed to be bad idea to transfer from one of these public sector final, defined benefit pensions. So, Clare, if you are somebody and many of the people who submitted questions who you said did, who has say, several defined contributions pensions and you're thinking of transferring or consolidating, what are the main pros and cons?"}
{"question": "What should be considered when evaluating the charges and fund choice for a pension, especially if responsible investment is of significance?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, there are several things that you need to think about. It's worth emphasising that Royal London're not financial advisers, so Royal London can't advice you on the best course of action. But in terms of pros and cons, there are a few to consider. So, the first thing is charges. Now, it might be worth consolidating your pension to one that has lower charges, but the cheapest isn't always the best. Now, you might be actually paying a little bit extra, for, extra for features that are really important to you. Secondly, fund choice. Now, Royal London talked earlier about where your pension money is invested and the fact that you don't have to keep it in default fund, for example. Now, most pension schemes have a number of different investment funds that you choose from, but some might have a wider range and others might have a focus on certain things. So, for example, responsible investment and again, that could be really important to you."}
{"question": "Why is it beneficial to leave smaller pension pots with restricted options, such as those from an older style pension, separate from a bigger pot to avoid triggering the money purchase annual allowance, as mentioned by a finance company?", "answer": "Now, if you've a few smaller pension pots of under 10,000, so, maximum of three. You might not want to transfer them because you could take them out without triggering the money purchase annual allowance that Royal London, you know, I just spoke about. So, it might be useful, even if you've got, you know, a kind of, a bigger pot to leave a few of these little pots because it wouldn't trigger that allowance. The last reason why you might want to combine your pensions is if one or more of your pensions has quite restricted options in terms of what you can do with your money when you retire. So, you might have to take all of your money in one go for example, or you might not be able to go into what's called drawdown and that could be because it's an older style, type of, pension."}
{"question": "What recommendations does Sarah Pennells have for individuals interested in transferring and combining their pensions?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, it is important to say of course, that there's no guarantee that by, by combining your pensions, they'll do any better than if you left them where they were. And in some cases, it can be a bad idea to transfer your pensions, especially if they're older ones because they can have a valuable features, such as a guaranteed annuity rate or a guaranteed value. Now, if you do want to find out more about transferring your pensions, I would really recommend that you watch Royal London webinar and if you're thinking of combining your pensions, it's a good idea to talk to a financial adviser."}
{"question": "What specific topics would you like Royal London to cover in future webinars?", "answer": "So, Royal London've covered a lot in the last, well, 40, nearly 45 minutes or so, but Royal London do have some time for some questions, but before Royal London do that there's one last poll because Royal London'd really like to know, what topics, what topic you'd like us to cover in future webinars. So, please vote now in the last poll of Royal London webinar."}
{"question": "What did participants at the session ask about regarding retirement options, considering Royal London's expertise in the subject?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, and Royal London didn't have the time today to talk about what happens at retirement. It's a massive subject as well and again, you know, in the questions before the session today Royal London did have quite a few questions on that as well because it does seem quite a confusing time and people aren't sure about the different options that are available."}
{"question": "What is the significance of Royal London's clear answer and the questions they have received?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes. So, okay, well, I think, you know, I think Royal London've got a very clear, a clear answer there. So, that's good to know. Also, the one on financial advisers, how to find a financial adviser and what they do. So, thanks very much for voting because that's really definitely given us some very clear answers about what you want to know about next. So, as I said, Royal London have got time for some questions, and Royal London've had a lot of questions coming in. So, again, thank you so much for submitting questions."}
{"question": "What is the topic of the Royal London webinar mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "The most popular one which is from Alex, I, I think it's something Royal London've just been talking about which is transferring pensions. So, hopefully Alex, you feel that Royal London've answered your question. Alex says, 'I've got a couple of different pensions from different jobs, plus my current one with Royal London, is it advisable to bring these into one fund.' So, Royal London have just covered it and as I mentioned there is the link to the transfers webinar. So, I hope you don't think that Royal London're ignoring your question but it's a really important topic, but I think the best thing probably, unless there's anything you want to add Clare. The best thing is possibly to listen to Royal London webinar."}
{"question": "What were some of the reasons mentioned by Royal London regarding whether consolidating pension pots into the same fund is a good idea or not?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes. I think there was a lot more detail in that webinar, but it is something and because people are changing jobs much more frequently than they did in the past, then people will have more pension pots and, you know, it, it's obvious-, you know, everybody, kind of, thinks, 'Will, will it make it easier administratively if I can everything in the same fund?' But for some of the reasons Royal London mentioned, there are, you know-, sometimes it might be a good idea but there could also be scenarios when not a good idea to do that. But, yeah, much more detail in the webinar on that."}
{"question": "What strategies should individuals adopt to navigate stock market volatility, particularly when investing in stocks and shares offered by finance companies like Royal London?", "answer": "But I'm not trying to be flippant when I say that, but stocks and shares, investments, I mean, they're, they're not a steady line. They do go up and down. You do get volatility. That does go along with investing in stocks and shares. But is there anything people can or should do, apart from, you know, understand that emotional side, which is it is hard to see the value of your money going down?"}
{"question": "What factors should individuals consider when determining their comfort level with risk and seeking financial advice, particularly in relation to long-term investments such as pensions, without directly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: I think when theres times of, you know, things are happening that maybe are causing fluctuations in the stock market. If people are looking at an app every day, then that's not giving them a, kind of, consolidated view over, over time. So sometimes that can make people feel a little bit more anxious. It's also very important, and you mentioned this earlier, you know, risk and, and what level of risk you're comfortable with is important, and that's when it can be really good to have a financial adviser who can talk through these things. Also it's worth remembering that pensions are a long-term investment and they do invest-, pension funds invest in a huge amount of different assets so they'll have different-, it, you know, it won't just all be equities, whether it can be a bit more of a, kind of, volatility. There might be commercial property, for example. There might be other, like, government bonds and things like that. So, there is-, you know, they're meant to, kind of-, that, that should deal with some of the risk. But obviously if you're in your twenties, for example, then you've got a long time until you can take out your pension, so perhaps, you know, worrying about what's going to happen then isn't as important as if you're getting closer to retirement. You might be thinking about, 'Well, maybe I should be in some more cautious type of investments.'"}
{"question": "What is the importance of having a financial adviser like Royal London to help determine the level of comfortable risk for individuals and alleviate worries?", "answer": "But, you know, I, I can't, kind of, say enough that actually having a financial adviser whose job it is to take that kind of worry away from you by helping you work out what level of risk you're comfortable for is, is really worth its weight in gold."}
{"question": "What is the impact of withdrawing from my pension at the age of 55 if I plan on carrying on working? Would it affect other pensions or are they considered totally separate?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, really good points, and I think it's also just worth saying that, depending on the age that somebody is, they may want to have a, a, an appointment with Pension Wise. Now, Pension Wise can't give anybody financial advice but it can talk you through the options. It's designed for people who have to find contribution pensions once they're over the age of 50 to think about the different options. But, again, it might just be useful to, kind of, just, just to have a conversation so you can find out. Pension Wise is-, it's a government website and you can book a-, you can have an online appointment or you can book a phone call, so that's maybe something to think about as well. Now, Royal London are getting quite a few questions about what happens to your money when you take it-, what happens to your pension when you take money out of it, which Royal London, sort of, said Royal London weren't going to cover but I don't want to ignore the questions that are getting voted up. So, there's one here from Phil, which is-, Phil Jones, who says, 'What is the impact of withdrawing from my pension at the age of 55 if I plan on carrying on working? Would it affect other pensions or are they considered totally separate?' So, Clare, what's, what's the answer to that?"}
{"question": "What are the options for investing the tax-free cash from the pension pot at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay, so let's, kind of, take the first part of this. So if Phil wanted to take, say, his tax-free cash, because he's still working, so he takes his tax-free cash and that money comes into his bank account and he moves the rest into drawdown, so the other 75% goes into drawdown. Now, drawdown is just like a, a, a pension pot. It's invested. It can be invested in similar assets, but that-, if he doesn't take any of, of that money, then he'll not have any additional income tax to pay. He'll not trigger that money purchase annual allowance Royal London spoke about. So, looking at it that way, just taking the tax-free cash, if that's what he needed, then that's probably the-, a better thing to do. If he decided he needed all of a fund, so say he had three different pensions but one of them was worth 50,000, for example, if he wanted to take all of that pension then, then 25% of that 50,000 would be tax-free, but he would pay tax on the other 75%. And, you know, so there's an income tax issue because he'd be paying more tax than he normally would be paying, but he would also trigger that money purchase annual allowance, which would mean he'd be restricted to paying a maximum of 4,000 into his other pensions. I think when Phil's saying would it affect other pensions or are they considered separate, so they, they are separate. They're separate pensions. For each of those pensions, you get 25% tax-free cash and you can do different things with them."}
{"question": "What are the options for accessing tax-free cash from pensions at Royal London and what are the consequences if you exceed the limit?", "answer": "So, you could move, you know-, take tax-free cash from one pension and move the other 75% drawdown but you-, you know, with another pension, you could take 25% tax-free cash and then buy an annuity with the part that's, that's left as well. So, you can do different things with them but from each of those pensions, you are allowed 25% tax-free cash. But if you go over that 25% tax-free cash and you access any of the rest flexibly, or you take one of those cash lump sums, so instead of taking that 25% tax-free cash, you take a cash lump sum and that comes with-, you know, I mentioned the fact that that comes, kind of, together, so you get the tax-free part together with the taxable part. There's an income tax issue but also, even for that 100, if he takes it, then he would trigger that money purchasing allowance."}
{"question": "What is the recent news about the pension dashboard that Royal London has talked about in their webinars?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Great stuff, thank you. Now, Royal London've had another question. Royal London have one from Kerry about is it better to keep pensions separate or transfer them but I think Royal London'll-, I, I think Royal London've done quite a lot on pension transfers, just in this-, in this webinar and I said Royal London did the whole webinar in June, I think it was, last year. So, I hope you find that useful. Jane's asked a question saying, 'If you've had a number of providers over the years, is there an easy way to find out where you hold differing pots of pension funds?' And, and, Clare, I mean, if I mention the two words pension dashboard, I think this is something Royal London've talked about in a couple of webinars, about how this is going to be, kind of, coming down the tracks and this is gonna be-, you'll be able to see all your pensions in one place, including your State Pension. But there was news about that just last week, wasn't there?"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Pension Tracing Service and how can it be helpful for individuals with forgotten or lost pension schemes, according to Clare Moffat from Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, so the pension dashboard is being put back a little, just so there can be more testing and, and things like that done. And it will make things much easier, but just now, what Jane could do is get in touch with the providers. If you can find the paperwork, get in touch with the providers. They'll be able to tell you how much is in the different funds. What happens if people move house sometimes, they don't remember to let different-, especially if it's a job, a few jobs ago, then you might not remember to get in touch with the pension scheme. So, sometimes people aren't getting the documentation to the right address. But if you think you, you know, you might have been in a pension and you can't remember much about it, then I think the Pension Tracing Service is a good service to use. Sarah, if you want to say anything more about that?"}
{"question": "What is the government service called that provides up-to-date contact details for old pensions, which Royal London can provide more information about?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, so, as, as you say about the pension dashboard, I think it was due to come in in 2024, I believe, but there has been, as you say, a, sort of, a slight delay on that. The Pension Tracing Service, now, it's really worth saying that this is-, this is a government service and it's called Pension Tracing Service but it doesn't actually trace the pension for you and, kind of, bring it to you. What it does do, though, which is very useful, it will give you the latest and, sort of, up to date contact details for an old pension that you have. So, what you need to do is either have your current name of your employer, an old name of the employer if you don't have that, or if you know the pension scheme name, then pop that information in. And that's a, a government website and Royal London can send out the details of that with the e-mail after the webinar or with the link to this webinar. And what the Pension Tracing Service does is it'll give you the up to date contact details. You then need to contact them. They'll normally ask you for your National Insurance number and some other questions, and then they'll tell you whether indeed you have got a pension with them and then you can find out how much it's worth. Now, when you're looking for the Pension Tracing Service, please make sure that you look at the, the gov.uk website because there are some other companies around that sometimes advertise and, you know, come to the top of a Google search or search engine search and they may charge you."}
{"question": "What type of questions has Royal London received regarding pensions and retirement?", "answer": "Whereas the government's Pension Tracing Service is free to use. Now, Royal London've had a lot of questions. As I said, a lot of them actually are about pensions and retirement, so I think that's definitely gonna be something Royal London do a webinar on. But there was another question that I just saw a moment ago and I was thinking, 'This would be a really good-, yeah, it's a question from Dave, who says, 'Is the income from the State Pension taken into account when income tax is calculated from private pensions?'"}
{"question": "What are the tax implications of having both State Pension and private pensions, especially with regard to Royal London's personal allowance?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, yes, yes and no. It sits in your income tax stack, which means that then if you have other pensions, then they will-, so it will use up-, that State Pension will use up some of your personal allowance, so Royal London've got 12,570 of Royal London personal allowance. State Pension will, as Royal London talked about earlier, so it's going to over 10,000, it will use up most of your personal allowance. So, so if you only had State Pension, then you wouldn't pay any tax on it, but if you have private pensions sitting on top of that, then you will use up the last bit of your personal allowance and then you'll pay 20% tax, 40% tax and, and so on. So it's a, kind of, yes and no question. So it might be that you-, say you retired at 60, then your State Pension wouldn't have kicked in. So, you would receive more of your private pension money without paying tax on it, but then when your State Pension does kick in, it essentially comes first. And then pensions are taxed like salary is taxed. It works in exactly the same way. So, you know, it just has, kind of, bands and thresholds, so once you're over the personal allowance, as I said, you're paying 20% tax."}
{"question": "What role does drawdown play in the financial services offered by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay. I'm gonna try and sneak in two questions in the last few minutes, so they're, they're hopefully short-ish answers. So, Simon has asked, 'What is a drawdown?'"}
{"question": "What is the difference between a drawdown pot and a regular pension pot at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay, so drawdown, if, if you think of a pension pot for the money you save up, so the money that you pay into, your employer might pay into and where the tax relief goes, if you think of that as one pot and it's invested-, as I said, it can be invested in lots of different things. Well, a drawdown pot is just another type of, of pot. It's just-, it's invested in the same way. It could be invested in exactly the same type of assets. The only difference is that one has-, you know, you have to go through a, kind of, pensions tax process to get from one to the other, and you would have an entitlement to tax-free cash. So once you take your tax-free cash and then move the rest into drawdown, you can do that. You don't have to do that all at once, so you could take-, you might have a, a pension pot of 100,000. You might take 10,000 and you could take 2,500 as tax-free cash and move the other 7,500 into drawdown. Then that money is just sitting available for you to take out when you want to take it out. So, you've got to be over 55 and you can't pay money into a drawdown plan. So if you can still make pension contributions, then the money would go into that, kind of, pension pot but the drawdown fund-, kind of, you don't ever need to take any money from that. Some people leave some pensions and pass them on on death."}
{"question": "Can individuals withdraw money from their separate pot in Royal London, but are unable to contribute funds into it?", "answer": "But when you take-, you can take money out of it, but you can't pay into that separate pot. So if you think of them as, kind of, two different pots but, sort of, invested in the same things."}
{"question": "Is it correct that tax relief is not provided on employer contributions according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay. Right, now one last question, which hopefully is going to be quite a quick answer. It's a question from Murray who wants to know, 'Tax relief is not provided on employer contributions. Correct?'"}
{"question": "What is the tax relief on employer contributions mentioned by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: I know. If you're a business owner, then an employer contribution, you'll get corporation tax relief on. So if you're a, a director of a business, so there is corporation tax relief on that. And, but I don't know if this question is in relation to, kind of, when Royal London spoke about salary exchange. Because what happens there is that you, your employer is making the full contribution on your behalf and, in exchange, you're getting less salary normally. So, so you're not getting income tax relief on that but you aren't-, well, it's not in the same way as Royal London mentioned. So what happens is your, your employer is going to pay more on your behalf and your salary goes down, so because your salary has gone down, you pay less income tax and less National Insurance. So that might be what he's, kind of, getting at but, yeah, so employer contributions do get tax relief, it's just not income tax relief."}
{"question": "What is the plan for Royal London in regards to addressing the questions about pensions and retirement in future webinars?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, well, great stuff. Royal London have had so many other questions but Royal London are going to probably carry some of these over into future webinars because, as I said, Royal London've had a lot of questions about pensions and retirement. But thanks again. A huge thank you to everybody who submitted questions in advance and during the webinar, and for voting in Royal London polls, all of which is appreciated. So, Royal London will be sending out a, a link to the recording of the webinar in the next day or so. In the meantime, thanks again very much for joining us and have a very good afternoon."}
{"question": "What did the Royal London pensions experts discuss regarding the State Pension in the recorded session on 6 December 2022?", "answer": "Catch up on Royal London pensions experts Sarah Pennells and Clare Moffat talking about how the State Pension works and how to find out what you're entitled to. They also answer some frequently asked questions about the State Pension. This session was recorded on 6 December 2022."}
{"question": "What will Clare Moffat from Royal London be discussing for the next 45 minutes?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: And I'm Clare Moffat and I'm Royal London's Pensions and Legal expert, and Royal London're going to spend the next 45 minutes or so talking about the State Pension. Sarah, it's a big topic and there's so much Royal London could talk about."}
{"question": "What does Royal London request participants to do during the webinar?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: It really is and when Royal London publicised this webinar, Royal London included a link where you could submit a question in advance and Royal London received over 90 questions, which is absolutely fantastic. So, Royal London've used these questions, Royal London've gone through them, and Royal London've used some of the most popular questions to help us, sort of, frame this webinar and Royal London'll be answering them throughout the webinar, but if you'd like to ask a question as Royal London go through though, then Royal London'd love to hear from you, but as with all Royal London webinars, Royal London can't answer questions about specific Royal London products, or about your specific circumstances, but do leave a comment or a question in the Slido link, and before Royal London go any further though and before Royal London get into the webinar, I'd just like to remind you that Royal London are recording this webinar and Royal London will send you a link in the future. So, everybody who's registered will get a link so they can rewatch or indeed watch the webinar. So, let's get on with the webinar then, Clare."}
{"question": "What kind of questions does Royal London receive about the State Pension age?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, the State Pension is a payment that you get from the government once you reach State Pension age, and I think before Royal London talk about how much you'll get, Royal London got so many questions about the State Pension age, I think it's worth spending a moment or two talking about when you get the State Pension, but before that, I think it would be a good time for Royal London first poll. So, the question is, 'Do you know your State Pension age?' So, please vote in Royal London poll."}
{"question": "What is the current state pension age and how has it changed over time for both men and women, as mentioned by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, I mean, it's, it's positive at the moment that so many people do know their State Pension age because, you know, with the State Pension age having changed, it wouldn't be surprising if a lot of people were quite confused, but it's-, Royal London'll leave it for a second or two more, because the votes are still coming in, but definitely, the majority of people say they do know. About 8%, so, sort of, one in twelve, saying they're hoping to find out today, which is also great. Okay, I think it's probably settled down now, so 77% are saying they know their State Pension age, 15% say they don't, and 8% say, 'Hoping to fund out today.' So, let's hope that Royal London can give you some information about that, but Royal London did have a lot of questions on this, including one from Anita who asked what the State Pension is at the moment, and it's a really good question because, as I just mentioned, the State Pension age has been rising. So, it used to be 60 for women and 65 for men, but now, it's 66 for both men and women, and that simply means that you have to be 66 years of age before you can claim the State Pension, but because the State Pension age has changed both for men and women, you know, you may know people who are older and who've been getting their State Pension since they were 65 if they're men or even as early as 60 if they're women, and because the State Pension age is rising, in the future, some people may have to wait until they're 67, 68, or possibly even older before they can claim their State Pension. So, anyone born after April 5th 1960 will be affected by the rise in State Pension age from 66 to 67, and under the current timetable, anyone who's birthday falls between April 6th 1961 and April 5th 1977 will have a State Pension age of 67."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of the government review on the State Pension age according to Royal London?", "answer": "Now, Royal London got another question which was from Vanessa and she wanted to know, 'What's the cut-off date for the rise in the State Pension age between 67 and 68?' Now, currently the law says that the State Pension age will rise from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046, so that effects those people born after April 5th 1977, which I just mentioned a moment ago. However, there was a review by the government a few years ago that recommended that this timetable was brought forward by almost ten years. It suggested that the State Pension age should rise from 67 to 68 between 2037 and 2039. Now, that new earlier timetable isn't currently the law, but it could be in the future, or there could be a different timetable, because 1st December, the current government launched a review into the State Pension age, and that is due to publish it's results by next May, at the latest. Now, Royal London had a few questions about the State Pension age, so I hope that's answered most of them."}
{"question": "What are the consequences if an individual fails to respond to the letter sent by the Department for Work and Pensions regarding State Pension claims, Clare?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, that's absolutely right, but I think that, sort of, confuses some people or they're not aware of it. So, when you're a few months away from your State Pension age, you will be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions, and it will tell you how to claim the State Pension. It should get in touch with you no later than two months before you reach State Pension age, but Clare, what happens if you don't reply to this letter?"}
{"question": "What is the benefit of deferring the State Pension offered by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, if you don't do anything, then you won't get your State Pension, it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your State Pension, once you reach State Pension age, then you don't have to take it. So, instead you can delay or put off claiming it. Now, that's sometimes referred to as deferring your State Pension. Now, you'll get a bit extra by delaying claiming your State Pension, but if you want it as soon as you're entitled to it, you do need to claim your State Pension."}
{"question": "Can you tell me when someone who has reached the age of 65 and applied for their State Pension receives their first payment, resembling a 'Happy Birthday from the DWP', assuming they are not explicitly associated with another finance company mentioned in the paragraph, such as Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, if you are currently 65, you know, you've sent back your letter to claim your State Pension, do you get your first payment on your 66th birthday, kind of, like, 'Happy Birthday from the DWP'?"}
{"question": "Can Alison continue working while claiming her State Pension with Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Not quite. So, the State Pension is usually paid every four weeks and it's paid in-arrears. So, that first payment you'll get will be for the previous four weeks, and Royal London had a question from Alison who asked whether she can take her State Pension when she's entitled to claim it and still carry on working. So, Sarah, what's the answer?"}
{"question": "Is it necessary to retire at the same time as claiming State Pension with Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, the short answer is yes. Your State Pension age and the age that you retire at are completely separate. So, you don't have to retire when you take your State Pension and you don't have to take your State Pension when you retire."}
{"question": "What are the various reasons that make using the services of a financial adviser a daunting prospect for many individuals?", "answer": "Youve decided that youre going to use the services of a financial adviser. For many of us, that can be a daunting prospect for a number of reasons."}
{"question": "How much could someone receive under the new or older basic State Pension system as explained by Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, Royal London talked about what the State Pension is and when you might get it, and the fact you need to claim it, but Royal London haven't discussed how much it is, and in order to explain that, Royal London need to talk about the two different types of State Pension. So, anyone who's reached State Pension age on or after April 6th 2016 will receive what's called the new State Pension, and to get the full amount, you need to have paid or been credited with 35 years of National Insurance. If you reach State Pension age before then, you'll come under the basic State Pension system, and in that case, to get a full State Pension, you need 30 years of National Insurance, but under the basic State Pension system, you may also get an additional State Pension, a second State Pension that, kind of, sits on top. So, Clare, talks us through the figures. How much might someone get either under the new or the older basic State Pension system?"}
{"question": "What is the weekly amount individuals entitled to receive from the new State Pension system at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay, so let's look at this chronologically. So, for people who retired under the old basic State Pension system, if they're entitled to the full amount, they'll get 141.85 a week, and if you're married, in a civil partnership, or living together, you'll each get that amount, as long as you've paid enough National Insurance. Now, for people who built up an additional State Pension, under the basic State Pension system, they could also get a significant amount more each week. Now, how much you get will depend on how many years you paid National Insurance for and how much you earned among other things. When you claimed your basic State Pension, you'd automatically receive this additional pension as well. Now, for people who come under the new State Pension system, they'll get 185.15 a week, again, if they're entitled to the full amount."}
{"question": "Can you provide information on whether Cheryl will be able to survive on the State Pension?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, I mentioned that the full basic State Pension is 141.85 a week. So, you'd think that the annual State Pension would be 52 times this, but that's not quite right. To find out the basic State Pension as an annual amount, you divide the weekly figure by seven and then multiply it by 365.25. Now, that extra .25 is to account for the leap year, and when you do that, it gives you the annual basic State Pension amount of 7,367.61. Now, for the new State Pension, where the weekly amount is 185.15, the annual amount is 9,660.86. Now, as Royal London heard in the Autumn Statement, both of those payments will go up by September's inflation rate, so that was 10.1%, from next April. So, that will mean that once that increase kicks in next April, someone getting the full basic State Pension will get 156.20 a week or 8,150.29 a year. Someone receiving the full new State Pension, well, they'll receive 203.85 a week or 10,636.60 a year, and Sarah, Royal London've had a question from Cheryl. Now, she wants to know whether she'll be able to survive on the State Pension. Now, obviously, it'll depend on Cheryl's circumstances, but you had a glimpse on what it was like to live on the State Pension, didn't you?"}
{"question": "What is John's question about the two different rates of State Pension in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, that's right. So, in the summer, I was joined by five of Royal London customers and Royal London tried to live on the equivalent of the State Pension amount for a week, and I have to say that it was quite a challenge, and Royal London did it in summer, and so, that was without winter bills, and I think Royal London all found it quite tough, accounting for, you know, trying to live on that budget, but I think the real thing that I took away from it was that, although it was, sort of, doable for a week, although it wasn't the kind of life that necessarily you'd want to have in retirement but it was, you know, doable, there was absolutely no slack in the system. So, you know, things like your boiler breaking down or if you've got a car, you know, car needing repair, it was really hard to get the money for those kind of bills. If you want to find out how I got on and the customers who joined me, then Royal London've got videos on Royal London State Pension hub. You can just see Royal London daily videos, how Royal London got on. Royal London'll give you the address of the State Pension hub in a moment. Now, Royal London had a question from John that was submitted in advance and he wanted to know why there are two different rates of State Pension. He says, you know, 'All pensioners use facilities like shops, they don't charge people who are on the basic State Pension less.' So, Clare, what's the answer to that?"}
{"question": "Why do some individuals receive varying amounts under the new State Pension system, despite the goal of fairness by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, Royal London could devote a whole webinar to this, but the short answer is that people who retired under the old State Pension, after April 2010 but before 2016, only had to have 30 years of National Insurance to get the full amount, whereas the new State Pension, well, it needs 35 years, and under the basic State Pension system, some people did very well. So, if they had the chance to build up an additional State Pension, but many women didn't get the full basic State Pension, never mind anything on top. So, part of the overall thinking behind changing the State Pension system was that it would be fairer overall, but Sarah, I hear from people who get very different amounts to these, so why is that?"}
{"question": "What are the protections put in place by Royal London during the transition from the old basic State Pension system to the new State Pension system?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, there could be several reasons. So, if somebody's getting less than the full basic or new State Pension, then that could be because they haven't paid or been credited with enough National Insurance. If someone's getting more, then it could be because they reached State Pension age before April 2016 and were entitled to an additional pension on top of their basic amount, or it could be to do with what's called your starting amount. So, when Royal London moved from one State Pension system to another, so from the basic State Pension to the new State Pension, there were protections put in place, to make sure that people who'd built up a bigger pension than the full new State Pension amount weren't worse off as a result of this changeover. Now, those rules meant that on April 5th 2016, there was effectively a snapshot of your State Pension entitlement at that date, and that snapshot looked at how much you would've built up under the old basic State Pension system, how much you would've built up under the new, new State Pension system, and it took the higher of the two amounts. Now, whichever was the higher of the two amounts became your starting amount. Now, then, any State Pension that you built up after April 2016 was under the new system."}
{"question": "What kind of information will Royal London be interested in from you and will they evaluate your financial status based on the extent of your savings?", "answer": "What will they want to know? How much do you have to tell them? Will they judge you on how much or how little youre saving?"}
{"question": "What are the concerns when trusting a financial company like Royal London with personal information?", "answer": "Then theres the question of trusting them with your information. Are they then going to try and rip you off? Or blind you with jargon? And how much will it all cost?"}
{"question": "What does a financial adviser at Royal London aim to achieve for their clients?", "answer": "A financial adviser is there to do the best for you. Theyre interested in your circumstances, needs and future aspirations. They want to use their skills and experience to find you a bespoke solution that you wouldnt be able to find on your own, and one that fits with your priorities and budget."}
{"question": "What are the four things individuals can do in advance to feel more prepared for their first session with an adviser at Royal London or any other finance company?", "answer": "But once youve found an adviser, whats next? Doing a bit of preparation beforehand can help you to feel more comfortable about your first session. To help you, weve put together four things you can do in advance:"}
{"question": "What are some recommendations from a reputable finance company for managing regular income and expenses effectively?", "answer": "A good place to start is to make a list of all the money you receive and pay out on a regular basis."}
{"question": "What sources of income are considered when looking at your finances, including salary, bonuses, and earnings from investments?", "answer": "Your income will include your salary and any other regular money you receive such as a bonus or earnings from investments."}
{"question": "\"What role does having a comprehensive understanding of your finances play in assisting Royal London advisers in determining your monthly financial plan and potential areas for saving and cutting back, considering your specific financial goals?\"", "answer": "Having this overall picture of your finances helps an adviser to work out how much you can afford to commit to your financial plan each month. It also enables them to identify where you might be able to cut back and save more, depending on what your financial goals are. As you look towards the future, it also helps them to think about how much income you might need when you retire."}
{"question": "What should I consider when selecting a financial adviser from a company specializing in finance, such as Royal London, to assist with decision-making based on my overall financial position, including my existing pension plan details and their current value?", "answer": "Its important that your adviser has an understanding of your overall financial position so he can help you make decisions. If youve already been saving in a pension plan, gather together details of what these are and, if you can, find out their current value."}
{"question": "What is the importance of having an annual statement from your pension provider, particularly if you are a member of Royal London?", "answer": "You should have received an annual statement for each of your pensions. These will give you the information that your adviser needs. If you dont have them to hand, dont worry, if you know the pension provider you can get in touch with them or your adviser will be able to help."}
{"question": "How much of your retirement savings can you take tax free with Royal London?", "answer": "Youre entitled to take up to 25% of your total retirement savings tax free. You can take your savings all in one go or as a series of smaller amounts, with 25% of the amount taken being tax free."}
{"question": "What happens if I choose to take all my tax-free entitlement at once with Royal London?", "answer": "If you take all your tax-free entitlement in one go, you cant leave your remaining 75% untouched in your plan. Youll need to either buy a"}
{"question": "How can one acquire National Insurance contributions for their State Pension as per the rules, and could Royal London provide further information on delaying the acquisition of State Pension?", "answer": "So, if your starting amount was higher than the new state, State Pension amount in 2016, which then was about 155 a week, you would keep that, and then, you'd build up more State Pension, either through paying National Insurance, if you're employed, or self-employed, or getting credited with National Insurance, perhaps because you're out of work and claiming benefits, for example, or if you're getting child benefit instead, and you could increase that amount further by delaying taking your State Pension, and Royal London'll discuss that in a moment, but Clare, I think it's worth just spending a few minutes talking about how you get National Insurance contributions for your State Pension. What do the rules actually say?"}
{"question": "Do National Insurance contributions from a company like Royal London only begin when they reach a certain level of earnings?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, let's talk about National Insurance contributions while you're working, first of all. So, Royal London pay National Insurance contributions until Royal London reach State Pension age to qualify for certain benefits and State Pension and-, is one of those. Now, Royal London start paying National Insurance if Royal London earn around 12,500, but if you earn between, between just under 6,400 and 12,500, the-, then even though you don't actually pay National Insurance, you are treated as having paid National Insurance, to protect your National Insurance record. So, that's called a qualifying year, but if you don't earn as much as the 6,400 amount, then that won't count towards your National Insurance, so there will be a gap. You also qualify if you're self-employed and pay something called Class 2 National Insurance contributions."}
{"question": "What are the criteria for automatically receiving National Insurance credits from Royal London, even if you are not working?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: That's right, Sarah. So, you can get National Insurance credits even if you aren't working. Now, sometimes, these credits happen automatically, so, for example, if you're on Universal Credit, Job Seeker's Allowance, or Employment Support Allowance. You might have to claim it, in certain scenarios though. So, for example, if you're on Statutory Sick Pay and you're not going to earn enough to have a qualifying year. So, that-, around that 6,400 amount I mentioned. Now, you will get National Insurance credits automatically if you're a parent or a guardian who is registered for child benefit for a child under twelve, even if you don't receive child benefit. Now, that sounds a bit odd. That's all to do with something called the Child Benefit Tax Charge. It was introduced about ten years ago. So, in households where one person has income over 50,000 and children live in that household and child benefit is claimed, the person who has that income of over 50,000 will receive a tax charge. Now, once they've got income over 60,000, that tax charge is the same as the amount of child benefit that would have been received. So, so, many people decide not to register for child benefit, because they'll have that tax charge, but if one spouse is going to be a stay-at-home parent, it's essential that it's that person who registers for child benefit for each child born and they tick the box that says they don't want to receive the child benefit payments. So, they're notifying of those credits happening, but they're not actually receiving any money monthly for child benefit. Now, that triggers those National Insurance credits, and it also triggers a National Insurance number being sent out to the child when they're approaching sixteen."}
{"question": "What are the consequences if a different parent from Royal London applies for child benefit?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, it's really important that the right parent, as it were, applies for child benefit, but what happens if the other parent has applied?"}
{"question": "What are some ways for parents to transfer National Insurance credits to another parent or grandparent, according to the information provided on the Royal London website?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, so Royal London're finding a lot of people who don't know about this, and the parent who's working filled in the form and said they didn't want child benefit, but you can transfer credits from one parent to another using an online process. It's also worth stating that it's possible for a grandparent or certain other family members to claim National Insurance credits when they're looking after grandchildren. So, maybe they stopped working to help out with childcare, but they don't have their 35 years of contributions. Now, the parents have to agree to this, but these credits can be back-dated to 2011, and they also cover non face-to-face contact during the lockdown period. So, if the grandparents amused the children via Zoom, for example, that would count. Now, if you want to know more about that, then the gov.uk website has lots of information on National Insurance credits."}
{"question": "What does Royal London suggest individuals should find out about the State Pension?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So, Royal London talked about how much you get and the State Pension age, but it's a good idea to find out when you'll be able to claim the State Pension and how much you might personally get. So, time for Royal London second poll, Clare. What's the question this time?"}
{"question": "What benefits can I gain from sharing my savings and investment details with my adviser at Royal London?", "answer": "You may have savings in ISAs or other savings plans or may have some investment in property. Having the details handy means that your adviser can see your overall financial position."}
{"question": "What considerations does your adviser take into account when helping you plan for retirement at Royal London?", "answer": "When youre planning for retirement, your adviser will want to make sure youre saving enough money to enjoy the retirement youd really like. Theyll also want to understand the kind of retirement you might want to have."}
{"question": "What considerations does your advisor take into account regarding your retirement income with the aim of ensuring you maintain a sufficient lifestyle without depleting your funds?", "answer": "If youre already retired and receiving an income, your adviser will want to make sure that youve got enough income to live the way you want to in retirement but also that you dont run out of money."}
{"question": "What options does Royal London provide for protection insurance to cover a mortgage and regular outgoings in the event of any unfortunate circumstances?", "answer": "You might be buying a new house, in which case youll be looking for a mortgage but also protection insurance to cover the mortgage and regular outgoings to make sure your family is covered if anything happens to you."}
{"question": "What benefits can writing a list of long-term plans provide for Royal London customers to determine the appropriate financial solutions based on flexibility and changing goals?", "answer": "Writing a list of these long-term plans will help your adviser to decide what financial solutions are right for you. Theyll be able to judge how much flexibility is needed with each solution in case your life moves on and your goals change with it."}
{"question": "What are the key areas that Royal London advises individuals to consider regarding the impact of coronavirus on their pensions or investments?", "answer": "At the moment it may be that youre concerned about the impact of coronavirus on your pensions or investments. You might want to think about some of these key areas:"}
{"question": "What services does the finance company specializing in under the name \"Royal London\"?", "answer": "Be prepared and dont be afraid to ask your own questions too. For example, what can you expect after the first session, how do they get paid, are they restricted to only recommending specific providers, what do they specialise in?"}
{"question": "What is the potential risk for investors who opt for flexible access with their savings in their plan at Royal London?", "answer": "With flexible access, your savings stay invested in your plan.

{"question": "What is the income threshold for individuals with a standard Personal Allowance to avoid paying tax at Royal London?", "answer": "As you can see, someone with a standard Personal Allowance wouldnt pay any tax if their total income from all sources during the year was less than 12,570."}
{"question": "How might withdrawing significant amounts from your retirement savings potentially lead to being subject to a higher tax bracket, ultimately resulting in more money being allocated to the government?", "answer": "The table also highlights how taking large sums of cash from your retirement savings could push you into a higher rate tax bracket meaning youd hand more of your savings to the government."}
{"question": "What are the income tax rates for UK taxpayers living in Scotland if they want to find out, and where can they visit for this information?", "answer": "*If you're a UK taxpayer living in Scotland and you want to find out what income tax rates apply to you, please visit"}
{"question": "What role can Royal London play in assisting individuals to maximize their tax-free allowances and optimize their retirement income taxation?", "answer": "A financial adviser will be able to give you a personal view of how your retirement income will be taxed. They can look at all the income you have coming in and help you make the most from your tax-free allowances."}
{"question": "How can I find out how much State Pension I will receive when I reach State Pension age?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Wow, okay, so this is interesting. Most people, at the moment, I mean, Royal London're still getting a lot of the votes coming in, so I'll it just-, let it settle, but about six in ten are saying they don't have a copy of their State Pension forecast and about 35-36% are saying, yes, they do. So, Royal London'll, Royal London'll let this run, just for a moment longer, but I think that's really interesting, because people were very confident about what their State Pension age is, which is great, I mean, that's a really good first step, isn't it? But not so much about actually what they might get when they reach State Pension age. So, I think it's settling down, so six out of ten say no, and just under three out of ten say that they, they have got their State Pension forecast. So, if you'd like to find out when you're going to get your State Pension and what you'll get, you can do this on the gov.uk website. So, if you go to gov.uk/state-pension-age and put in your date of birth, it will tell you the date that you'll be able to claim your State Pension and how old you'll be, but it won't tell you how much you'll get. So, in order to find that out, you need to go back onto gov.uk this time /check-state-pension, it's on-, the information is on the slide. Now, if you've got a government gateway account, then you can fill in an online form that tells you how much State Pension you're going to get when you reach State Pension age. If you don't have a government gateway account, you'll need to set one up. Now, it's actually fairly straightforward to do, but there are a few steps involved and you will, for example, need an email address so you can get a confirmation code. Now, Royal London've written a four-step guide on how to get your-,"}
{"question": "What information will I find on my State Pension forecast provided by Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So, I think Royal London've lost Sarah there, briefly. So, Royal London've written-, as Sarah said, Royal London've written this four-step guide on how to get your State Pension forecast online, and that's on Royal London State Pension hub, and there's lots of information there on what you need to do to create that government gateway account. Now, there are two other ways of getting your forecast. So, applying online is the quickest way, but if you can't look at the internet, then you can fill in the form BR19 and send that off by post, or you can phone up the Future Pensions Centre and ask them to send it out to you, but you have to be reaching State Pension age in more than 30 days to do that, so don't wait until it's too late. So, I think it's worth talking through the information that you'll get on your State Pension forecast. Now, first of all, your State Pension forecast will tell you when you reach State Pension age and how much you're on track to get as weekly, monthly, and annual amounts. So, you can see that on screen, but these amounts are not guaranteed. It's made very clear in a disclaimer that the State Pension forecast isn't a guarantee and is based on current law, and it doesn't include any increase due to inflation. Now, I think it's probably worth checking your forecast a, a few times, especially if you've been contracted out at any point, and I'm going to explain what that means in a minute. Now, the next figure on your State Pension forecast, well, it's an amount that you're entitled to based on your National Insurance record."}
{"question": "What is the COPE figure, or Contracted Out Pension Equivalent, mentioned in the State Pension forecast provided by Royal London?", "answer": "Now, that's so far, and below that, an amount that you would get if you continue to pay National Insurance, or to be credited with it, until you reach State Pension age. Now, your forecast will-, it's also going to tell you, you that if you're working until to reach State Pension age, you still have to carry on paying National Insurance. So, what-, why is that? Well, I think this puzzles a lot of people. Now, the reason for this is that National Insurance that Royal London make are used in part to fund the NHS and also to pay state benefits, including the State Pension. So, so, if you've already got a full National Insurance record of 35 years and you're due to get your full State Pension of 185.15 a week, you can't just decide not to pay National Insurance, unless you're not working or you don't earn enough to pay National Insurance in the first place. However, while the rules say that you have to continue to pay National Insurance until you reach State Pension, pension age if you're working, you don't have to pay National Insurance once you reach State Pension age. So, say you decide to carry on working beyond your State Pension age, well, there's no National Insurance to pay. Now, there is an exception to that, and that's if you're self-employed and paying Class 4 National Insurance. So, you'd pay that if you have profits over around 12,000. Now, if that's the case, you'll actually carry on paying Class 4 National Insurance until the end of the tax year that you reach State Pension in. Now, there's one figure on the State Pension forecast that Royal London're really keen to explain and that's the COPE figure, or Contracted Out Pension Equivalent. Now, what's that?"}
{"question": "What is the significance of contracting out and its impact on one's State Pension in relation to their occupational pension scheme?", "answer": "Well, if you worked for an employer and you joined their pension scheme, this is particularly common with public sector final salary pensions, but it used to be the case with some private sector pensions too, then you may have been contracted out. Now, don't worry about the jargon here. Contracting out, well, it just means that you and your employer paid less National Insurance contributions, but there was a promise that the occupational pension you were in, well, it had to pay a certain level of benefits, or if it was a defined contribution pension, where you build up a fund, then the savings were held separately. Now, similarly, if you were self-employed, you also paid less National Insurance. Now, in these scenarios, you would be entitled to the basic State Pension, but not additional State Pension. So, what does that all mean? Well, your State Pension might be lower, but you'll have additional benefits in your private pension, and this is where it can get very confusing for people, because you could have paid 35 years of National Insurance but not be entitled to the full new State Pension amount because you were contracted out. So, in that case, part of your pension, now that's that COPE, COPE, Contracted out Pension Equivalent, that's going to be paid by your occupational pension scheme when you retire. So, you're not going to get that from the Department for Work and Pensions in the same way that you receive the rest of your State Pension, and I, I think it's confusing, the way this information is set out on your State Pension forecast and, and some of the people I've spoken to, well, understandably, they think they've to take the COPE figure off whatever their State Pension forecast is telling them they'll receive, but that's not the case."}
{"question": "How does this opportunity provided by your adviser contribute to Royal London's goal of fostering a trusted relationship with their clients?", "answer": "This gives your adviser an opportunity to show you how open and transparent they are as a business and helps you build up a trusted relationship."}
{"question": "What kind of qualifications and experience does Royal London have in assisting individuals like you, and do they provide a copy of their fee structure prior to signing an agreement?", "answer": "When it comes to charges, theyll usually give you a copy of their fee structure before you sign on the dotted line. Theyll also be happy to talk you through their qualifications and the experience they have in helping people like you."}
{"question": "What should one consider to feel comfortable with their potential new adviser from the beginning, especially when it comes to entrusting their money for an extended period of time?", "answer": "Hopefully these pointers will help you to feel prepared and confident about seeing your potential new adviser for the first time. They might end up looking after your money for a long time, so its important to feel comfortable with them from the get-go."}
{"question": "What are some common inquiries Royal London receives regarding being contracted out and improving pensions, particularly from individuals who have enough years before reaching State Pension age to receive both the full State Pension and their COPE amount?", "answer": "That COPE figure amount, well, it's just for information only. So, you don't need to subtract it from the State Pension amount. Now, Royal London had a lot of questions about being contracted out, both from people who want to know what it means and how it works and from people who want to know if there's anything they can do to improve their pension, and for those who are further away from retirement, then they might have enough years before they get to State Pension age to mean that they could get so it could get the full State Pension and their COPE amount too."}
{"question": "What are voluntary National Insurance contributions and when might you pay them for years where you haven't already paid National Insurance or don't have a full qualifying year, according to Royal London?", "answer": "But what about if retirement's a little bit closer? Well, you might be able to increase the amount of State Pension you get and receive the COPE figure. So, how does that work? Well, that brings us quite neatly onto voluntary National Insurance contributions, and again Royal London had a lot of questions about this. So what are they and, and what might you, you pay them or when might you pay them? Well, you might be able to make voluntary National Insurance contributions for years where you haven't already paid National Insurance, or where you've paid it but maybe you don't have a full qualifying year. So your State Pension forecast will tell you whether you're on track to get that full State Pension amount, but it's not going to tell you the years where you have gaps in your National Insurance record. So in order to find that out you need to check your National Insurance record. Now, you can do this online, on the Gov.uk website if you've got that Government Gateway account that Sarah mentioned, or you can telephone the National Insurance enquiry line. Now, it's something that's really worth doing, and I know that Sarah checked her National Insurance record for the first time about fifteen years ago and she found some gaps in her National Insurance record and she wasn't even aware of them. So if she'd known earlier then she would have been able to fill those gaps, but she's going to be working long enough to pay the National Insurance anyway but of course not everyone is going to be in that position."}
{"question": "What is the value and timing of buying voluntary National Insurance according to Royal London?", "answer": "Now, I think this will answer the question that Royal London had from Nigel, which is if you only work for part of a tax year and therefore you only pay National Insurance for part of a year, does that count as a full year for your State Pension and does it depend on how much you earn? So, it does depend on what you earn. So say you work for half of a year and not for the other half of a year. Now, if in that six months that you work you have more than 52 times 123, now that 123 is a weekly minimum amount and that, that will make that an annual figure that that's, that's that 6,400 I mentioned earlier, well then you don't pay contributions but you are treated as having paid them. And it doesn't matter about the other six months when you didn't work. You don't need to pay for voluntary National Insurance contributions or to be officially unemployed. But say you only had 5,000 of earning in that six months then that wouldn't be enough. So if you find that there are gaps in your National Insurance record you might be able to make voluntary National Insurance payments, and again Royal London had lots of questions on this so Royal London're going to try and answer a couple now. Now, one of the questions asked by Tony, was that if buying voluntary National Insurance, well, is it good value? When is the best time to buy? So, what's the answer to Tony's question? Well, it's worth finding out how much it would be to buy additional years, now these are often very good value. So you pay a lump sum to buy back one extra year and then you get one 35th of the full pension, so around 300 a year from April."}
{"question": "What are the contact numbers for the Future Pension Centre and the pension service if you want to inquire about the benefits of voluntary National Insurance and you have reached State Pension age?", "answer": "So if you're quoted 824 for a year for example, so that's the rate of class three voluntary contributions for the current tax year, then you only need to survive for three years once you receive your State Pension for this to be worthwhile, although it does depend on your tax situation. Now, the cost of those voluntary National Insurance, it does depend on the class you're buying, whether it's class two or class three, and the tax year you're buying the voluntary National Insurance for. So, if you're going back six years for example it's going to cost less because you're plugging a gap. Sorry, less because-, than it would to plug a gap in the current tax year. Now, it's worth saying that paying a voluntary National Insurance well it doesn't always leave you better off, so it is worth speaking to someone about that. So for example if you don't have any other pensions from a workplace or a private pension, for example, if you pay voluntary National Insurance, well, you might get the full State Pension amount but you could disqualify yourself from being eligible for a benefit called pension credit. Now, if you're still some years from retiring then paying for voluntary National Insurance, well, it can be a waste of money if you're going to carry on and paying National Insurance too. Now, you can find out whether or not you'll benefit by ringing the Future Pension Centre, and if you want to know whether you'll benefit from voluntary National Insurance and you haven't yet reached State Pension age. If you have reached State Pension age then you need to ring the pension service. So both those numbers are on screen now."}
{"question": "What is the eligibility criteria for going back further than six years in the National Insurance record, and how does it differ for men and women?", "answer": "So there's two other points that I think are worth making, and that's that you can normally only go back six years to plug any gaps in your National Insurance record, but until April 5th next year, so 2023, you can go back further, potentially as far back as 2006. After April 5th next year you'll only go back-, you'll only be able to go back six years which is the standard. But those extra years only apply to those born after April 5th 1951, if they're a man, and after April 5th 1953 if they're a woman. And remember that probably if, if you're around, kind of, the age 45 mark then you're probably going to have enough years so it might not be worth doing this until you're a bit older and check your record again. Royal London had another question from Gary. Oh, I think Royal London might have Sarah back. I'll just carry on talking about the question, Sarah, I-, Royal London've not got any sound I don't think yet."}
{"question": "What is the advantage of delaying taking the State Pension according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, I think I'm back in the room. My computer just turned itself off which has never happened but, anyway, there you go, so thanks for holding the fort. But as you say, Royal London had a question from Gary who wanted to know how beneficial it would be to delay taking his State Pension. And, you know, Royal London mentioned delaying taking your State Pension a bit earlier in the webinar but I do think it's worth talking through the numbers as to how much extra you'll get if you don't take your State Pension once you reach State Pension age. So the rules say that you can delay taking your State Pension by as little as you want to, but you'll only get any extra money if you delay taking it by at least nine weeks. If you do delay it by nine weeks you'll get an extra 1% of your State Pension amount for every nine weeks you delay taking it. So if you delay taking it for one year then that works out at just under 5.8% extra, and on a State Pension of 185.15 a week, that works out at an extra 10.70 a week. Now, under the old basic State Pension system, that extra amount that you got by deferring was, first of all, more generous and you could take it as either a lump sum or an additional weekly amount. But under the new State Pension system you don't have that choice. But, Clare, why would someone delay taking their State Pension? What's the advantage of doing this?"}
{"question": "What knowledge and tips does the investment articles and guides from Royal London offer to assist in understanding the realm of investing?", "answer": "Royal London investment articles and guides are full of knowledge and tips to help you get to grips with the world of investing."}
{"question": "What is the impact of the State Pension on the taxable income for individuals working at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Well, you, you might still be working. So you receive your State Pension free of income tax, but it's still the first chunk of income when Royal London look at the order of taxation. So then any income you receive from working, well it will just sit on top of it. So say I had part time earnings of 12,000, well I wouldn't be taxed on that because it's under the personal allowance, but if then I reached my State Pension age and I took my State Pension, then that State Pension would come first. It would use up most of my personal allowance apart from about 3,000 of my earnings would then make up to that personal allowance figure but then I would be paying income tax on the rest of my earnings, basic rate tax. So if you don't need it then it might make sense to delay taking it until you do need it."}
{"question": "How does Royal London calculate the break-even point for delaying State Pension to make it financially worthwhile?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Are there any calculations though about, you know, breaking even? Putting it crudely, how long you need to live for in order for it to be worth your while delaying taking your State Pension?"}
{"question": "What is the answer to Karen's question about using her ex-husband's National Insurance record to increase her State Pension, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So there are calculations that, that can put a figure on this. So for example saying that if you live seventeen years it will be worth the delay, but it's actually more complicated than that because it depends on your income tax saving as well. Now, Sarah, Royal London had a question from Karen as well. Now she said that her mum's 67 and she's been getting her State Pension for the last year, she gets 102 a week. She's divorced and she's heard she might be able to use her ex-husband's National Insurance record to boost the amount of State Pension she gets. So what's the answer?"}
{"question": "What are the rules regarding the use of a spouse or ex-spouse's National Insurance record to boost the State Pension for women reaching State Pension age after April 6th, 2016?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, I'm afraid the answer may not be the one that Karen wants, but just to explain why, under the old system before April 2016 man and women could use their spouse, ex-spouse or late spouse or civil partners' National Insurance record to boost the State Pension they received. Now, there are different rules about how you could use that and, and in reality it was mainly women who did this because they were far more likely not to have a full National Insurance record and so wouldn't get that full basic State Pension. So if Karen's mum had reached State Pension age before April 2016 she would have been able to use her ex-husband's National Insurance record if it was better than her own and claim a basic State Pension based on that. Now, her ex-husband wouldn't have received any less as a result of this and he wouldn't have to give his permission for her to use his National Insurance record. Once Karen's mum told the Department for Work and Pensions it should have happened automatically and she'd have received that State Pension for the rest of her life. However, the rules changed when the new State Pension came in, and since then women who reach State Pension age from April 6th 2016, only those women who paid the reduced rate of National Insurance, it's often referred to as the married women's stamp, only those who paid that married women's stamp in the last 35 years are able to use their ex-husband, husband's or late husband's National Insurance record. Now, that reduced rate of National Insurance was actually abolished for new users in 1977, but some women who had elected to pay that married women's stamp before 1977 did carry on doing so."}
{"question": "What is one valuable asset that can be shared during a divorce settlement involving a couple, which is particularly important to consider in the case of Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: One other point to make is that when a couple divorce, additional State Pension, well, it can be part of the financial assets that are shared on divorce, but this can only happen at the time of the divorce when the financial settlement is being dealt with. Now, this can be a really valuable asset. All pensions are a valuable asset to share on divorce, so don't forget about additional State Pension."}
{"question": "Can individuals associated with Royal London make voluntary National Insurance contributions after they commence receiving their State Pension?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Well, Clare, would Karen's mum be able to pay voluntary National Insurance contributions or is it too late for that because she's already taking her State Pension?"}
{"question": "What options does Clare have to fill the gaps in her National Insurance record, as previously described by a finance company, if she was born after April 5th 1953?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: No, she can get hold of her National Insurance record and, as Royal London described earlier, if she's got any gaps then she might be able to pay voluntary National Insurance contributions. So as she was born after April 5th 1953 she'd actually be entitled to go back until 2006, remember that option is only available until April 2023 though. After April she would only be able to go back a maximum of six years."}
{"question": "Is there a way for someone who has seven years of State Pension from working in countries in the European Economic Area and eleven from working in the UK, and twelve years to go before retiring, to pay for missing years and reach the full 35 for the UK State Pension, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Now, it is also worth saying that if Karen's mum's weekly income is below 182.60 a week, and that's from the State Pension and any private pensions that she may have, she may be able to claim a benefit called pension credit, which was mentioned very briefly earlier on. Now, this is a means tested benefit for people who are of State Pension age or older and it can be worth around 3,300 a year. Now, the pension credit itself isn't worth that much but it's what's called a gateway benefit and it means you're then eligible for other help such as with housing costs, if you're over 75 you get a free TV license and so on. So, it's definitely worth looking into, and again you can do that online on the gov.uk website. Now, Royal London had several questions about your State Pension if you're abroad, so Royal London had one from Gary, Vanessa and Andrew. So, I think Royal London'll look at this one, which was one-, someone who said she has seven years of State Pension from working in countries in the European Economic Area and eleven from working in the UK, and she has twelve years to go before she retires. Now, she says, 'I know I have reached the ten minimum years for the new UK State Pension but is there a way to pay missing years to reach the full 35 for the UK?' So this is what Royal London've just been discussing about-, well you have anyway, about buying voluntary National Insurance contributions, but as you said it's not always the case that paying for voluntary National Insurance contributions will benefit you."}
{"question": "What is the situation with the State Pension being paid in EU countries as per Roman's question, particularly from Royal London's perspective?", "answer": "So it definitely is worth checking with the Future Pensions Centre before you do that. Now, Royal London had another question, Clare, about the State Pension abroad which is from Roman, who wants to know about the State Pension-, the UK State Pension being paid in EU countries. What's the situation there?"}
{"question": "What happens to your State Pension if you live in a country without a tax agreement with Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So you can choose to be paid your State Pension into a bank account in any country that you want it to be paid, but your State Pension will only increase each year if you live in the European economic area, so the EU plus another few countries, Gibraltar, Switzerland, and countries that have a social security tax agreement with the UK. So an example of a country with a tax agreement is the United States, so you will get your State Pension increase if you live there. Now, there is no agreement with Australia though, so if you live in Australia you won't get an increase to your State Pension. Now, confusingly there is a tax agreement with Canada and New Zealand, but you won't get an increase there. So I think that highlights that it's worth checking what would happen if you're thinking of retiring abroad and, you know, which country you're thinking of retiring to. Now, if you did move back to the UK though then it would go back to the current rate, so with those increases."}
{"question": "What kind of questions have been coming in for Royal London during this discussion?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, well thanks very much Clare. So I think Royal London've got some time for some questions, and I know some questions have been coming in although I can't see them as I'm talking to you via my phone. So, Clare, do you want to pick the first question?"}
{"question": "What steps has Royal London taken to put key climate commitments in place and why is investing responsibly important to their business?", "answer": "Were committed to making a difference. Which is why investing responsibly is at the heart of Royal London business and why weve taken the step to put key climate commitments in place."}
{"question": "What is the most frequently asked question regarding National Insurance contributions at a prominent finance company?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, I'll-, they're on my phone as well so I'll have a look. So the top question Royal London have in popularity is from Ian and he says, 'How do I find out how many years of National Insurance contributions I've made and if they're sufficient to qualify for the basic State Pension?'"}
{"question": "What should Ian consider in addition to obtaining his State Pension forecast from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: So I don't know whether just to kick off with that, so Royal London mentioned obviously getting your State Pension forecast earlier on, and that's definitely a really good starting point. Because that will tell you whether you are entitled or on track to get the full State Pension because it will tell you what you've built up so far and what you're going to be entitled to or likely to be entitled to or likely to be entitled to once you reach State Pension age. Now, it does make certain assumptions such as normally that, you know, you're carrying on paying National Insurance or being credited with it. But I think it's also really important as well to get your National Insurance record, which I know Clare talked you through a moment ago, because that will actually show you as well whether there are any gaps, and specifically whether you could go back and make up those gaps. Clare, anything else that Ian should think about?"}
{"question": "What should one consider when deciding whether making voluntary contributions is worth it or not, as mentioned earlier by a finance company?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: No, I think that is probably most things, isn't it? I mean, Ian, sort of, mentioned the basic State Pension but if he's not retired then he'll be on, you know, the new State Pension as Royal London mentioned earlier. But I think, you know, it's always worth finding out whether actually, you know, making voluntary contributions is going to be worth it or not."}
{"question": "What are the factors that could prevent individuals from receiving the full State Pension despite having more than 35 years of National Insurance contributions, and does Royal London have any insights on this issue?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay, so the next question is from Karen. So, 'Why is it that you might not get full State Pension when you've got more than 35 years of National Insurance contributions?' Now, I think Royal London've got a few questions that are like this as well, and someone else is mentioning what happens, what's the effect of contracting out, someone mentions a specific scheme. So, just again to, kind of, to summarise that, Sarah, do you want to deal with this or?"}
{"question": "What is the explanation provided by Royal London regarding the impact of contracting out on State Pension amounts?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, so as, as you explained when Royal London-, a bit earlier on in the webinar, if you were-, I think the thing that's confusing about being contracted out is that it's not a personal decision because it depends on the scheme you were in and is-, I know you mentioned it's mainly the public sector schemes that were contracted out but it could have been a private sector scheme as well up to a certain point. But you didn't actually as an individual make a decision to contract out, although you would have benefited from paying a lower rate of National Insurance, as would your employer. So I think this bit can come as a bit of a surprise because, you know, if you get your State Pension and you're under the new State Pension system it, kind of, looks like you're not getting full amount but it's just, as Royal London explained earlier on, that you're getting that from your-, basically from the pension scheme that you were contracted out of. So that could be why it looks like you're not going to get the full State Pension, it's just you're not getting the full amount from the state. But as you I know explained, Clare, maybe it just worth, sort of, reiterating, you can make up those gaps."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of climate change on Royal London and how can it be mitigated to prevent a rise in temperatures by 2100?", "answer": "Climate change is the challenge that will define Royal London generation. In a rapidly changing world Royal London are on track to see temperatures rise by more than three degrees by 2100 if immediate action is not taken to curb global carbon emissions."}
{"question": "What efforts is Royal London making to harness the potential of pensions and contribute towards the shift to a sustainable, low-carbon economy?", "answer": "And were working hard on your behalf to unlock the power of pensions and invest in the transition to a low-carbon economy."}
{"question": "What does the research by Royal London suggest about their customers' concern for climate change and how does it influence their strategic goals?", "answer": "Royal London research shows that Royal London customers care about climate change and Royal London believe the best outcome is that, collectively, Royal London achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and this informs Royal London strategic goals. Royal London're committed to:"}
{"question": "How can a finance company contribute to society's transition to a sustainable world while ensuring positive investment returns?", "answer": "of your money. It can play a significant part in helping society transition to a sustainable world whilst providing positive investment returns."}
{"question": "How does Royal London actively collaborate with the companies it invests in to address their carbon emissions and promote sustainability while considering the societal impact?", "answer": "Royal London work actively with the companies that Royal London invest in to influence their plans to reduce their carbon emissions and transition to a sustainable world in a way that considers the impact on society."}
{"question": "What are the costs and charges associated with managing workplace pensions and investing retirement savings in the Royal London schemes for 2021?", "answer": "There are costs involved in managing your workplace pension and investing your retirement savings to help these to grow. Here you can find out the costs and charges that applied to all of Royal Londons workplace pension schemes in 2021."}
{"question": "What does the finance company responsible for administering members' pension plans and investing their retirement savings decide in terms of charges?", "answer": "Royal London take from members pension plans for administering their plans and investing their retirement savings. These charges are decided by Royal London."}
{"question": "\"What are the potential reasons for individuals to question the status of their State Pension on their birthday and how does Royal London address this issue?\"", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yep. Malcolm asks, 'How soon before my 66th birthday should I apply?' Guidance is vague and he's heard that it can take months to process it. Now, Sarah, you mentioned about that DWP will send you a letter out a couple of months before your birthday. I suppose the problem is that not everybody lives in the house that, you know-, records aren't always complete and that's why people might wonder, 'It's my birthday today, I've not received my State Pension,' kind of, 'What's, what's happening?'"}
{"question": "What steps should be taken if someone approaching State Pension age has not heard from the DWP (Department for Work and Pensions) in a couple of months?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yeah, and there were some issues I know at the start of the year with some people have delays to getting their State Pension. So, as I said, the DWP should contact you a few months before you reach State Pension age and if it hasn't contacted you two months from when you reach State Pension age it's definitely worth getting in touch with them because, you know, people obviously wait for their State Pensions. The last thing I think especially in the current cost of living climate people want is to-, is to have that delayed. If they've decided they want to take their State Pension when they can, which obviously many people do, then you don't really want to be waiting for that payment. So I would say it's, you know, if you're a couple of months away and you've not heard from the DWP then do get in touch with them. And then they can tell you how you can claim the State Pension and fingers crossed there won't be any delays to your payment."}
{"question": "Is it possible to receive the State Pension from Royal London before reaching the designated State Pension age?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: There's also been a few questions about saying can you get the State Pension earlier than your State Pension age?"}
{"question": "What does Royal London's review of the State Pension age entail and when are the results expected to be released?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Yes, I mean, the short answer to that is no. It is actually something that has been discussed I think off the back of the State Pension age for women rising from, well, as was initially planned from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020, and then that was actually brought forward because of the State Pension age rise in both men and women to 66. And there have been various reviews into not just how much the State Pension age rises by in the future but actually whether the system itself needs to be changed in more subtle ways, and one of the proposals that was made a few years ago, I think possibly back in 2017, was that women could elect-, well women and men, sorry, could elect to maybe get a lower amount of State Pension before State Pension age but that was never taken forward. As I mentioned earlier on, Royal London do have another review that's into the State Pension age now and Royal London should get the results of that before next May, so there may be something in there to allow people to take a state-, a lower State Pension early but I don't know that's on the cards. I don't know, Clare, whether you've heard anything?"}
{"question": "What is the goal of Royal London's initiatives to combat climate change and when do they aim to achieve net zero emissions across their investments?", "answer": "Royal London support initiatives that encourage progress in the fight against climate change. Royal London are committed to achieving net zero by 2050 across Royal London investments to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement."}
{"question": "What efforts is the finance company taking to minimize its impact, enhance efficiency, and prioritize environmental considerations in relation to its offices and operations?", "answer": "Well continue to look for ways to reduce Royal London impact, become more efficient, and always think about the environment when making decisions about Royal London offices and operations."}
{"question": "What steps does the finance company, which takes its responsibility seriously, take to measure its performance against its commitments and report its environmental footprint to customers and members publicly?", "answer": "Royal London take this responsibility seriously, so well measure how were performing against Royal London commitments on a regular basis, and will report Royal London own environmental footprint publicly to Royal London customers and members too."}
{"question": "What is the approach used by Royal London to ensure a standardized measurement for greenhouse gases?", "answer": "The world of emissions can seem complex, but it can be boiled down to this: measuring greenhouse gases (GHG). The term GHG covers many types of gases, so to make things simple and comparable across businesses and other polluters, Royal London translate the climate impact of all GHG into a single measure: 'Carbon Dioxide Equivalent' (CO"}
{"question": "What is the impact of the financial services industry on the environment, specifically in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, as referenced in the paragraph?", "answer": "e). For example, a gas twice as potent as Carbon Dioxide (from a climate impact perspective) is assigned 2 tonnes 'CO"}
{"question": "How does Royal London use carbon intensity to evaluate the emissions of larger companies relative to their size?", "answer": "e. But what if the larger company has lower emissions relative to its size? To assess this, Royal London use carbon intensity. This gives us a measure of emissions per unit, allowing for the companys size (units could be sales, revenue, total assets or market capitalisation). Using this approach, Royal London can more easily see whether the larger company has a lower carbon intensity despite having a larger absolute footprint."}
{"question": "How does Royal London deal with the challenge of calculating the aggregate carbon intensity of all companies and securities in its portfolio?", "answer": "Things get more complicated again when considering portfolios. With portfolio emissions Royal London face a dilemma: how to aggregate the carbon intensity of all companies and other securities represented in Royal London portfolio into a single figure."}
{"question": "What is the potential issue with using a simple average of carbon intensities for the equities portfolio at Royal London?", "answer": "Imagine a portfolio of equities with 100 underlying companies. Holdings of these companies within a portfolio may vary in size considerably, so a simple average of their carbon intensities (with equal weighting across all 100 companies) may be misleading. Under this metric, holdings in a company representing 1% of a portfolio would have the same impact on total portfolio emissions as a company representing 10%."}
{"question": "What are the costs associated with purchasing, selling, and maintaining assets within the pension funds of the company you have invested in, which is not directly under Royal London's control?", "answer": "which are the costs incurred in buying, selling and holding assets within Royal London pension funds into which your plan along with other members plans are invested. These costs are not directly within Royal Londons control."}
{"question": "What is the procedure to access the costs and charges information for default investment arrangements within the pension schemes provided by Royal London?", "answer": "To view the costs and charges information for all the default investment arrangements within Royal London pension schemes download Royal London costs and charges spreadsheet."}
{"question": "What is the mobile app that can be used to access growth figures and charges information for Retirement Solutions pension plan?", "answer": "For growth figures and charges that are personal to you please refer to your yearly statement. Alternatively, if you have a Retirement Solutions pension plan, you can see this information on Royal London mobile app, which can be downloaded from the App Store for iPhones or Google Play for Android devices."}
{"question": "What is the deadline for topping up contributions for individuals who need more than six years of contributions at Royal London?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Same as you, kind of, there's been rumblings about this for, for quite a few years and it does feel like you could have people who maybe are-, have ill health and things like that and they would want to receive it earlier than, than other people. But, yeah, I think Royal London'll wait and see what's in the review that comes out but I think, you know, as you quite rightly said the answer is, no, your State Pension happens at your, your State Pension age. That's the current law. I think quite a few questions about topping up contributions, kind of, when's the right time to do it, and I think just to reiterate, if you do need more than 6 years of contributions and, you know, you satisfy those age criteria, so 1951 for a man, 1953 for a woman, then you've only got until April 2023 to get more than 6 years worth of contributions. So check what your gap is, check whether you'd still be working long enough to maybe you don't need to top up the contributions, because if you're working for another fifteen years then you might be able to fill that gap. So investigate that but do that sooner rather than later, because if you do need to top up more than six years then now is the time to do it."}
{"question": "What benefits can be obtained by contacting the Future Pension Centre at Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: And I think it is also worth saying, I mean, you mentioned that you may not need to pay for voluntary National Insurance if you're still working and you'll-, essentially you'll be paying them anyway because you're employed or self-employed, but I mentioned pension credit when referring to Karen's mum's situation but also, you know, there is no point frankly in buying extra national-, voluntary National Insurance contributions if that just means you're going to mean you're not eligible for a benefit, core pension credit. So that's also worth looking at and I think that's why it's such a good idea to try and ring the Future Pension Centre because that's what they will-, you know, they will tell you whether it's something that you can benefit from. And I did actually ring them the other day just to check that you can get through on the phone number, and certainly when I tried you can. So Royal London gave you the number in the webinar so that's definitely worth looking up."}
{"question": "What theme does Clare Moffat believe Royal London has covered most of the questions about during the session?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Okay. So, I think-, I think that, kind of, generally, I think there's quite a theme, a general theme, and I think Royal London've probably covered most of the questions during the session or when Royal London've just spoken about them now. As I said, most of them are, kind of, related to contracting out and topping, topping up. So, yes."}
{"question": "What is the final poll that Royal London would like to conduct during the webinar?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, fantastic. Well, thanks very much for all the questions and thanks to you Clare also for stepping in when my computer decided to go on strike. But before Royal London go I think there's just one final poll Royal London'd like to do. So the question for this last poll is will this webinar encourage you to do something about finding out about your own National Insurance record? So, I can't see what people are voting so, Clare, you're going to have to fill us in here."}
{"question": "What kind of individuals are part of a group with influence over their pensions, who have strong commitment to their investments in the future?", "answer": "A group of people with power in their pensions. People who aren't just investing for the future but are invested in it."}
{"question": "Can Royal London expect a significant majority of people to vote in favor, with only a small percentage expressing uncertainty?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: Yes, okay. So just wait and let people put their votes in. Really high number, definitely, sitting about 94, 92 just now. Some people might be a good idea and 1% or 2% doubt that they will."}
{"question": "What percentage of people expressed interest in checking their National Insurance record in relation to Royal London's services?", "answer": "Clare Moffat: So Royal London'll just give it a minute or two to see if that settles down. Okay, so I think that's probably about us. So 88% said that they would definitely be finding out about their National Insurance record. 10% said that might be a good idea and about 3%, 2%, 3%, still moving a little bit, said that they would doubt it."}
{"question": "What benefits did Sarah Pennells find in accessing her own National Insurance record provided by a finance company?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Okay, well 88% is fantastic and I would have said, if my computer hadn't died, but I found it so useful getting my own National Insurance record so I'd really-,"}
{"question": "What updates will Royal London provide through email in the coming days?", "answer": "Sarah Pennells: Brilliant. Well, it is, it's just such a good thing to do so brilliant that almost nine out of ten people say that they'll get their National Insurance record. So thanks very much indeed for listening and to everybody who submitted a question either in advance of this webinar or whilst Royal London've been doing it, and I'm sorry that Royal London haven't been able to answer all of your questions but Royal London will read them all and Royal London will maybe try and incorporate some of them into, kind of, future articles or future webinars. Royal London will get back in touch with you by email in the coming days and Royal London'll send you a link to the recording of the webinar, and of course Royal London'll be doing more webinars next year. So until then, thanks very much for joining us."}
{"question": "Where did Clare Moffat, a pensions expert, join the Pension Awareness team for a live session on 2 November 2022 to discuss pensions and tax?", "answer": "On 2 November 2022 Royal London pensions expert Clare Moffat joined the Pension Awareness team for a live session all about pensions and tax. Learn about how pension tax relief works, the limits to be aware of and more."}
{"question": "What were the topics covered by Clare Moffat and Sarah Pennells from Royal London during the recorded session on 5 July 2022?", "answer": "Join Royal London pensions experts Clare Moffat and Sarah Pennells as they cover the pros and cons of transferring a pension and what you need to know before making a decision. This session was recorded on 5 July 2022."}
{"question": "What is the focus of today's webinar at Royal London and why are they discussing pension transfers?", "answer": "Hi, I'm Sarah Pennells and I'm the consumer finance specialist here at Royal London. Welcome to this webinar. I'm joined today by Clare Moffat and Royal London're going to be spending the next 45 minutes or so talking about pension transfers. Clare, could you explain first of all a bit about what your job involves? I, I was going to say why you're here but that sounds quite rude. And also why Royal London are talking about pension transfers today."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of Royal London discussing pension transfers and why are they interested in offering webinars on specific subjects?", "answer": "Hi everyone and hi Sarah. So, I'm a pension and legal expert at Royal London. I talk and I write about how pensions work. Now, the reason Royal London're talking about pension transfers is because you all asked for it. Royal London did a poll and this was the top result and Royal London're really keen to offer webinars on subjects that you want to hear about."}
{"question": "What is the distinction between terms like 'transfer', 'combining', 'consolidating', 'merging', 'switching', or 'bringing pensions together' in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Well, I've got a few questions for Clare to get the ball rolling but then there will be plenty of time for you to ask your questions and I noticed that Royal London've got some are already coming in. Now, it's important to say at the outset that Royal London can't answer specific questions if you've got a Royal London pension plan but Royal London can take general questions about pension transfers. So, Clare, you use the term, and I just used it as well a moment ago, 'transfer' but I think people may have heard the term 'combining' or 'consolidating', or 'merging' or 'switching' or 'bringing their pensions together', so do all these various terms refer to the same thing or is there a difference between them?"}
{"question": "Why would individuals consider transferring their pension at Royal London?", "answer": "So, all of these terms mean the same thing if, and it's quite a big if, Royal London're talking about moving from one pot of money to another pot of money, what's known as 'defined-contribution pensions' when you know what's being put into it. Moving different pots of pension money perhaps you and your employer have been adding to and putting them in, in one pot, but Sarah, why might someone want to transfer their pension?"}
{"question": "What is the most popular answer in the Royal London poll regarding the number of different pensions people have?", "answer": "I think it's kind of helpful to think about Royal London working lives and the fact that, you know, most of us don't have a job for life these days, and in fact Royal London may not want that. Royal London may have a number of jobs through Royal London working live and the more jobs Royal London have the more pensions Royal London're likely to have to go with it and that can be quite hard to keep track of. I was, sort of, thinking back about my own career so far and I've had seven different jobs, people on this webinar may have had more or less but since automatic enrolment came in you're likely to be put into your workplace pension scheme soon after you join, so you've had a lot of jobs, that could be a lot of pensions to keep track of. So, just to get a feel of everyone's experience here I'd like to do the first of Royal London polls, so you'll see the question coming up on the screen. The question is, how many different pensions do you have? So, please vote in Royal London poll. So, just seeing the-, some of the results coming in, I've, I've-, I voted myself so I said I've got seven different jobs but-, or I've had seven different jobs, I actually have four different pensions from them so that seems to be two to four currently is the most popular answer. Some people have more than ten though I've noticed, which is a lot of pensions frankly. Clare, any thoughts on what Royal London're seeing so far?"}
{"question": "What is the perception of job transitions in the finance industry, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "It's really interesting. I'm surprised that there's actually so many between two and four, I thought Royal London might see a bit more of a split. I'm definitely in that category too, between two and four. I've had five jobs since I qualified, so yeah, but interesting."}
{"question": "Can individuals in professions like nursing, teaching, or firefighting, such as Clare, transfer their pensions with Royal London?", "answer": "And one in five people who voted so far have got between five and seven pensions and, again, you know, that's, that's, that's a good handful of pensions, depending on the kind of person you are it may be easy or hard to keep track of and Royal London'll cover that bit later on in the webinar. So, two, two to four definitely seems to be the most popular answer at the moment. I think it is important to emphasise though that whether you are someone who has two to four pensions or you've got ten or more pensions, Royal London're not saying that just because you have lots of pensions you should transfer them into one. So, I think it's worth spending a bit of time talking about who can't transfer. So, if Royal London have an example of somebody who's a, you know, a nurse or a teacher, or a firefighter, Clare, can they transfer their pension?"}
{"question": "Can individuals working in the public sector transfer their pension to another scheme, excluding Royal London, if they have jobs like those mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "No, they can't. So, if you work in the public sector and you're doing jobs like those you mentioned or other jobs then you normally can't transfer to another pension and that's because those pensions, they-, well, they don't have pots of money. So, the current pensioners who are receiving their pensions from these schemes, well, their pension is paid from money from taxation and contributions from current employees. Now, there is one major exception in the public sector though and that's if you work for local government, it does have a fund of money and you can transfer out of that one."}
{"question": "What are the advantages of having a pension, like the one offered by Royal London, that guarantees a regular payment for life?", "answer": "No, if you're in the local government pension or you've got a private-sector defined-benefit pension, so that's when someone knows how much they're going to receive when they do retire, it's generally assumed to be a bad idea. Now, that's because these pensions make this promise to pay you a regular payment for the rest of your life. Now, it's almost like getting your monthly salary except you'll get less, of course, and if you've got a husband or wife and they live longer than you then they will get a regular payment for their lives too, so that's a really valuable benefit to have."}
{"question": "What is the process to determine the charges that one currently pays in their pensions, particularly if they have multiple pensions from different providers?", "answer": "So, in this webinar Royal London're gonna be concentrating on pension transfers if you have a defined-contribution pension, so that's the kind of pension that Royal London and other pension providers offer. It's a pension where you build up a pot of money while you're working that you then can take an income from when you retire but if you have a final salary or another kind of defined-benefit pension and you'd like to find out more about that then the MoneyHelper website does have a guide to what to think about if you want to transfer a defined benefit pension. Now, MoneyHelper is an impartial website that's backed by the government so you can find a guide there. So, there are I think a number of reasons why it can make sense to transfer, now Royal London're not gonna tell you what to do because Royal London're not financial advisors but Royal London will go through some of the most common pros and cons. So, one reason for transferring your pension is for lower charges, namely if the pension provider that you're moving your pensions to charges less than you're currently paying. I think, Clare, the question that, that, sort of, follows from that is how do you find out what you're currently paying in charges if, say, you've got two, three or four different pensions?"}
{"question": "What is the maximum percentage of charges allowed for the default fund in a workplace pension at Royal London?", "answer": "So, all pension providers apply a yearly charge for managing your pension and this is known as the annual-management charge, or you might see it as AMC. Now, that's taken automatically, so once a year or once a month, from the value of your pension savings. Now, I know that this might seem really complex but comparing the charges on your pension is important. Now, that information can be found in a variety of places, so perhaps online in the key features document, which would be the document you will have been given when you joined the pension, in the annual statement you'll get from the pension provider. It might be on the app if your pension provider has one. Now, if you have a workplace pension then the charges for the default fund, now that's where most people would be, have to be 0.75% or less of the total pot size. Now, the default fund is the fund that you will have been put into when you're automatically enrolled."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the upper limit of 0.75% on charges set by Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah, you're right. Actually percentages don't mean much to many of us because Royal London actually like to see a pounds-and-pence amount but Royal London do need to be able to compare the percentage of one scheme to the percentage of another scheme. That upper limit of 0.75% on charges, well it would mean if you had, let's say, 10,000 in your pension fund you would pay no more than 75 as an annual-management charge. Now, many providers with modern schemes will charge a similar percentage but you might have older-style, perhaps, personal pensions and they might be charging a lot more. And in fact one of the great things about workplace pensions is that they're generally quite transparent, so it's quite easy to see what charges apply, and that's that AMC that I just mentioned. Now, this is precisely to help people see what their charge is, even if they're not pensions experts."}
{"question": "Could transferring pensions to Royal London potentially result in paying the same, more, or less compared to other existing pensions?", "answer": "Okay, so say you have a workplace pension and you're gonna transfer other pensions, could you end up paying the same on all those pensions you transfer or could you end up paying more or indeed less?"}
{"question": "What are the benefits of having a workplace pension with respect to the charges, especially for individuals with a smaller pension pot at Royal London or any other finance company?", "answer": "Well, it can't be guaranteed but, as I mentioned, the default fund in a workplace scheme has to charge 0.75% or less as that annual-management charge and many are less than that. So, in a workplace pension everyone in the scheme pays the same charge as a percentage of how much money they have in their pot, so that's particularly beneficial to those people who don't have a huge pension pot at the moment. So, maybe they're young, maybe they've had career breaks or perhaps have started saving later, whatever the reason. Now, if you aren't in a workplace pension then one of the benefits of putting all of your pension money together is that often, well, the more you have in your pension pot the lower the charge as a percentage."}
{"question": "What should I consider when combining my different pension pots in order to save on charges with one provider like Royal London?", "answer": "Okay, so let's think of an example. Say you have four pots of pension money from the past, from other schemes you've been in. Two of the pensions have 10,000 in them, one has 40,000, and another has 50,000. Now, you might be paying around 0.70% in charges for each of them so that would add up to 770. So, you might think, 'Well, there's no point in combining them.' But if you put them altogether in one of the pots you might only pay 0.50% in total because you have over 110,000 in one place, so that would be 550, so that's, that's a real saving. A pension provider might charge 0.70% in charges if you've got up to 100,000, but then it would reduce to 0.50% if you've got over 100,000, for example. But these rates and thresholds will vary from one pension company to another, so you would need to investigate and make sure that you aren't moving from a cheaper pension to a move expensive one."}
{"question": "What are the retirement options available through Royal London transfer?", "answer": "Okay, so let's look at another reason why you might want to transfer and that is the options that you get at retirement, so what might that include?"}
{"question": "What is the significance of the faff factor when considering transferring your pension and are there any methods to simplify your pension administration from different providers?", "answer": "Well, some workplace pensions don't offer as much choice about how you can take money out of your pension at retirement. Now, they might only let you take all of the money out in one go so that could-, that could, could mean that you're actually paying a lot more tax than you should or they might only offer the chance to buy an annuity and that's when you use all of your pot and you convert it into a regular income for your and maybe your husband or wife's life. It might also not offer something that's called 'drawdown'. Now, ignore the terminology. All that drawdown means is that your pension money stays invested in a pot and you can take your tax-free cash and then you can maybe take some money monthly, like an income, perhaps because you've actually stopped working. Or you might just want to take your tax-free cash and leave the rest invested because you're still working and you don't actually need any monthly income. Or you might just want to take larger sums every now and then, so that might be because you or perhaps your spouse has one of those defined-benefit schemes Royal London mentioned, and that could give enough monthly income for you for the everyday bills, but maybe you just want some extra money from time-to-time, so maybe for holidays or a new car, or, or for Christmas presents. Some pensions, well, they also might not offer the same choices to your family if you died and that could be really important to you, but, Sarah, what about the faff factor? This possible hassle of having different pots of money with different providers. Is that a genuine reason to think about transferring your pension or are there ways to streamline your pension admin?"}
{"question": "What has Royal London discussed about investment choice, Clare?", "answer": "I think the faff factor is a really interesting one and I do-, I do believe it's a personal decision and for some people it can make a big difference having their pensions all in the same place, they can see exactly what they've got and having them dotted around could be a real barrier to thinking about their retirement but for other people it just isn't a problem at all. It is worth saying though if you are somebody who finds the admin a bit of a faff if you have your pensions dotted around, there is something called the Pensions Dashboard which is being rolled out from next year. Now, that's going to be an online dashboard that means you'll be able to see all your pensions in one place, even if they're from different pension providers. So, Royal London've talked about charges, Royal London've talked about the faff factor. What about investment choice, Clare?"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of transferring pension savings to a provider like Royal London for a wider choice of investment options?", "answer": "Well, Sarah, it is important to remember that when you save into a pension your money is invested and different providers offer different investment options and you could benefit from a wider choice on where to invest your pension savings if you transfer."}
{"question": "What are some factors to consider when comparing the default fund offered by your workplace pension provider with other investment options, taking into account the potential charges associated with actively managing your investments?", "answer": "That's a good point but it's also worth thinking-, worth thinking about what your workplace pension offers. You mentioned, Clare, earlier on that most people who are in a workplace scheme are in the default fund and that's because that's the fund that you're put into if you don't actively decide to go elsewhere, but your workplace pension provider will offer funds as well, so that could be your starting point to look at what they offer. Having said that, some people do like the idea of actively managing, choosing their investments, and may want to transfer but bear in mind there may be additional investment charges that come with it."}
{"question": "What factors should investors consider regarding responsible investment and environmental, social, and governance factors when choosing an investment provider like Royal London?", "answer": "That's right, Sarah, and you can think about the type of investment options based on your needs and objectives so, like, thinking about a provider's approach to responsible investment and environmental, social and governance factors. Now, these help investors measure the ethical and sustainability impact of a business or sector but it's important to repeat the point that your pension is invested and its value can go down as well as up, so there's no guarantee that combining your pension will give you a higher income when you retire or a bigger pension pot, because you could get back less than you pay in."}
{"question": "What are some of the valuable benefits offered by older-style pensions, like a guaranteed annuity rate, which Royal London mentioned?", "answer": "So, Royal London talked about some of the reasons why it might be worth thinking about transferring but let's look at some of the reasons why transferring may not be a good option or some of the things that you need to check before you think about transferring. So, there's a range of valuable benefits that some of the older-style pensions might have had. One that people may have heard of is called a guaranteed annuity rate. What's that?"}
{"question": "What are some potential benefits of combining pensions, and what should individuals with guaranteed annuity rates from the past consider before doing so, particularly with respect to Royal London?", "answer": "That's right, Sarah. There are valuable benefits sometimes and combining your pensions can seem like a really good idea but you need to check that you aren't losing something that's really valuable. Now, you mentioned guaranteed annuity rates. You wouldn't see these on a modern pension but it was quite common in the past, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, so you might have it. Now, this is a guaranteed minimum level of income that a pension provider will pay when you start taking your pension savings and you convert your pot into a regular income for life. So, it's generally going to be higher with your existing provider than the rates available in the market when you retire."}
{"question": "What is being discussed here by the finance company, with the possibility of a significant monetary gain, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "What are Royal London talking about here? Are Royal London just talking about a few extra pounds a month or could it be an extra chunk of money that's quite sizeable?"}
{"question": "What is the significance of the lifetime allowance (LTA) and how will it impact pensions beyond April 6, 2023?", "answer": "The lifetime allowance LTA is a limit on the value of pension savings you can build up without paying a tax charge but has been removed from 6 April 2023. It could still affect your pension in other ways, please see the bottom of this page for more information."}
{"question": "What are the common rates offered by Royal London and how do they compare to today's rates in terms of income from a pension pot?", "answer": "Well, I mean, it all depends on how much money you've got in your pot. So, common rates offered are around 9 to 11%. I, I have seen higher than that as well. Now, that's about double the best rate that most people can achieve now. So, well, what does that mean? Well, it means that for every 100 in the pension pot that you have, you get 9 or 11 as income a year compared with 5 for every 100 that you would get based on today's rates."}
{"question": "What percentage of tax-free cash can individuals typically take as a lump sum when commencing their pension with Royal London or other similar finance companies?", "answer": "Well, tax-free cash, that's definitely another one to think about. Now, that's the money you can take as a tax-free lump sum when you begin to take your pension. Now, it's currently set at 25% of the funds and I think it's something that most people are quite familiar with but some older pensions might allow you to take out a higher percentage of tax-free cash. Now, in some circumstances you can transfer this benefit to your new pension."}
{"question": "Does the age to access your pension differ among providers, or is it solely regulated by rules and regulations?", "answer": "What about the age that you can take your pension? Does that vary from provider to provider, or is that solely governed by rules and regulations?"}
{"question": "What should be considered when seeking financial advice to ensure you don't lose any valuable benefits from your pension, such as those provided by Royal London?", "answer": "Well, currently your can't take money out of your pension before you're 55 unless you're seriously or terminally ill, and that will be 57 by 2028, and that is a regulatory-, you know, that comes from legislation. But some people do have the right to take it earlier, now that could be because of the type of job you did and you can keep this, right, if you transfer, but some rules do apply. If you're taking financial advice it is really important here to make sure that you don't lose this right. Now, of course it doesn't mean that you have to take your pension when you're younger, it just means that you can if you want to. Now, you might have also heard of something called a loyalty bonus and normally to get that bonus you have to keep the money in that fund. Another one to watch out for is if you're currently an employee and you don't want to stay in an employer's scheme then you'd need to check that any employee benefits like a contribution from the employer, if you would still get that if you moved to another pension, because you wouldn't want to lose out on that. So, financial advice can be crucial on working out whether you'll lose valuable benefits or perhaps if you can transfer but still keep these benefits."}
{"question": "Is consolidating pensions into a single account advisable for individuals with pension funds below 10,000 who wish to access their funds but also continue saving with Royal London?", "answer": "Yes. If you've got any pensions below 10,000 and you might want to take money out of them, so you're at the age where you can access your pensions, but you would still want to save into pensions, then transferring into one big pot might not be a good idea for you."}
{"question": "What is the annual allowance offered by Royal London for this tax year?", "answer": "The annual allowance for this tax year is 60,000, which means you could contribute 60,000 before a tax charge may apply."}
{"question": "What happens to your annual allowance if your taxable income exceeds \u00a3260,000 in a tax year at Royal London?", "answer": "If you have taxable income for a tax year greater than 260,000, you'll have your annual allowance for that tax year restricted. This means that for every 2 of income you have over 260,000, your annual allowance is reduced by Your reduced annual allowance is rounded down to the nearest whole pound."}
{"question": "What happens if you earn 360,000 or more with regards to your annual allowance at Royal London?", "answer": "Your annual allowance cant be reduced to less than 10,000. So if you have an income of 360,000 or more youll have an annual allowance of 10,000. If you're caught by the restriction, you may have to reduce the contributions paid by both you and/or your employer or an annual allowance charge will apply."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact on the pension contribution limit for individuals who have withdrawn some of their pension savings, according to a finance company?", "answer": "If you've already taken some of your pension savings, your future pension contribution limit may be restricted to the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA)."}
{"question": "What is the criteria for the money purchase annual allowance, especially for individuals who decided to flexibly access their pension savings post 6 April 2015?", "answer": "The money purchase annual allowance is lower than the annual allowance and it may apply if you chose to flexibly access your pension savings after 6 April 2015."}
{"question": "Can individuals transfer their pensions with Royal London if they have assessed the pros and cons and made the decision to do so?", "answer": "So, what happens if you've been through the pros and cons and you think, 'Right, I want to transfer one or more of my pensions,' can you just go ahead and do it?"}
{"question": "What are the rules for transferring a defined-benefit pension to a defined-contribution pension if it is worth 30,000 or more, according to Royal London's earlier discussion?", "answer": "Well, it's worth remembering that these rules are designed to protect people from being worse off by transferring, so these rules apply if you've got a defined-benefit pension, Royal London spoke about them earlier, that's worth 30,000 or more, and you want to transfer to a defined-contribution pension. So, that's going from where, you know, you're being promised a certain amount on retirement and you want to move it to where you're just going to have a, a pot of money, and it's up to you with what you do at retirement. A defined-contribution pension that's worth more than 30,000 but with a guarantee about what you'll be paid when you retire, so Royal London just discussed that a moment ago, and you would lose this benefit by transferring, so that's the-, kind of the two situations there."}
{"question": "What is the percentage of people who have thought about combining their pensions, as mentioned in the Royal London poll?", "answer": "Okay. Clare, I think that's really helpful and I'm aware that Royal London've thrown a lot of information around about charges and pros and cons, and things to think about. So, let's just do another poll before Royal London move onto questions. It's 'who has thought about combining your pensions'? Please vote now in Royal London poll. I'll just leave it a moment while the results come through, so-, okay, well in some ways I guess it may not be surprising bearing in mind this webinar is all about pension transfers, but 95% currently have thought about transferring-, just slipping slightly as I'm talking, so about 5/6% say they haven't but the vast majority have thought about it. As I said, obviously, this is a webinar about pension transfers so it kind of makes sense but Royal London'll just give the results a moment to, to, to settle still. Any thoughts, Clare, on that? On the fact that that percentage is-, well, it's pretty high, isn't it?"}
{"question": "Can Royal London customers consolidate all their pensions when they change jobs without losing any benefits?", "answer": "It is quite high and I'm not surprised because I often get asked questions by my own friends actually when they're talking about they've moved jobs, they don't really understand how things work, and can they move all of their pots together? So, I think it is something that often Royal London want to, you know, think about different admin elements of Royal London lives and how Royal London can make it better but Royal London are a bit worried about, well, you know, might Royal London lose anything? So, it's definitely something that Royal London are asked a lot about."}
{"question": "Is it recommended to seek financial advice from an advisor, such as Royal London, when considering pension transfer, regardless of the situation?", "answer": "Yeah, okay. So, it's settled down. 94% said they had thought about it and 6% haven't. So, Clare, you mentioned a moment ago, just before Royal London did the poll, about getting financial advice, why it's a good idea to get financial advice and what you could lose by not having it. So, is it a good idea to get financial advice from an advisor if you are thinking of transferring your pension, no matter what the circumstances are?"}
{"question": "What value does Royal London place on financial advice, even if it's not a legal requirement?", "answer": "Well, an advisor will consider your whole life. They'll look at your needs, wants, income, the type of risk you're willing to take and they'll-, they can also look-, if you've got a spouse, they would look at both of your lives. They would then look at potential solutions and Royal London're not just talking about, you know, pensions here, Royal London would be talking about different investments as well. They'd look at pros and cons before drawing up a list of options and providers, and making a recommendation. But if you're younger and you've only got small pots of pension and you're not likely to have some of these, these benefits that I've mentioned earlier, then, you know, it, it might be more difficult to find an advisor and it's more likely, as I'm-, you know, it's more likely you're not going to have some of these guarantees and you're only going to have these defined-contribution pensions. So, in that situation then it's probably easier just to try and look at your pensions yourself, compare them, look at the charges, and work out if transferring is a good idea. But as your pots grow over the years I would always recommend financial advice. Now, I, I mentioned the legal requirements for getting advice when you make a transfer and, and at Royal London Royal London really believe in the value of financial advice. Even if there isn't that legal need, you could benefit from taking advice before making a transfer."}
{"question": "How can individuals find their lost pensions to potentially generate additional income upon retirement, especially if they have worked for multiple employers during their career?", "answer": "Most people end up with more than one pension, especially if you work for different employers over the course of your career. Tracking them down could provide you with extra income when you retire. Follow these three simple steps to find your lost pensions."}
{"question": "What is the impact on the annual contribution allowance if one opts for flexible access to their pension savings as offered by a finance company like Royal London?", "answer": "If you choose to access your pension savings flexibly, certain payments will trigger the MPAA. This means your annual allowance for contributions into defined contribution pensions would be reduced from 60,000 to 10,000 a year."}
{"question": "How much time do I have to notify all the pension plans I contribute to about the MPAA being triggered, if I am affiliated with a finance company?", "answer": "You'll have 91 days to inform all pension plans you're contributing to that the MPAA has been triggered. If you join any new pension plans, you'll have a responsibility to let them know."}
{"question": "What implications does the MPAA trigger have on the maximum contribution to defined contribution plans for members of a defined benefits pension plan at Royal London?", "answer": "If you're a member of a defined benefits pension plan and you've triggered the MPAA, the 60,000 annual allowance still applies to your total contributions/accrual. However, within your total 60,000 annual allowance, the maximum you can contribute to any defined contribution plans will be 10,000 before a tax charge applies."}
{"question": "What is the definition of Lifetime Allowance and its significance for pension benefits at Royal London?", "answer": "Lifetime allowance (LTA) was previously defined as a limit of pension benefits that could be built up without an additional tax charge applying."}
{"question": "What should I do if I believe the removal of the LTA charge may impact my pension rights, according to recommendations from Royal London?", "answer": "Until 6 April 2023, if you took benefits from your plan that were more than the lifetime allowance, you paid a charge on the excess known as the LTA charge. The LTA limit was 1,073,100. From 6 April 2023, the LTA charge is removed, although the lifetime allowance could affect your pension rights in other ways. Royal London recommend you speak to a financial adviser for information if you think this applies to you."}
{"question": "How can I find out if I have any money in a pension with my old employer if I don't have the paperwork?", "answer": "Great stuff. Well, thanks very much Clare. So, Royal London've had loads of questions coming in, which is fantastic. Thank you very much first of all for submitting your questions. So, I'm gonna go down from the most popular ones and work my way down, so the first question I think I'll take actually, that's from Susan and it says-, Susan says, 'I think I had a pension with my old employer but I can't find the paperwork, how do I find out if I have any money in it?' And Susan, it's a really good question and it's one I think, again, that lots of people have. So, there's a couple of thoughts on that. Firstly, if you know who your employer is and that's not meant to be as stupid as it sounds, I mean, your employer may have been taken, taken over. So, if you've got contact details for your employer then contact them, you don't necessarily need to have pension paperwork for them to find out whether you've got a pension with them or not, so that's one option but if you think, 'Well, actually it was so many years ago I don't even know who the employer is or I don't know who the pension provider is,' then there is a, a government website or government service called 'The Pension Tracing Service' which is completely free to use and if you go onto the gov.uk website you'll find that what comes up is basically you can type in the name of your employer or your pension provider, so the last name that you knew for them and it will give you the up-to-date contact details. So, what this service doesn't do is basically scurry around and find out if you've got a pension and tell you how much it is, but it will give you the up-to-date contact details either of the pension company or the employer but you can then contact them."}
{"question": "What is the government service website for Pension Tracing, keeping in mind other non-free services that might be available?", "answer": "It is worth saying that if you're looking for the Pension Tracing Service, do make sure you go onto the gov.uk website because there are sometimes other services that may charge you but the government service is free to use. Clare, I don't know whether you've got anything to add to that whilst I just take a quick look at the other questions that are coming in."}
{"question": "How will the Pensions Dashboard of Royal London help individuals who have lost track of their pensions?", "answer": "Yeah, no I think just the same that it's-, I think there's a few questions that are, kind of, covering off this actually that, you know, people lose track of their pensions, you move house, you try to, you know, tidy up, get rid of paperwork and things so this is-, you know, it's, it's not uncommon at all. Now, it will help when Royal London do have the Pensions Dashboard because Royal London will be able to see those pensions that Royal London have in one place but definitely, as you mentioned, you know, if you-, if you can't find or you know you had pensions but you can't find any information, then that's a great step to take."}
{"question": "What is Mark's question regarding consolidating pension pots and its relevance to Royal London?", "answer": "Good stuff. Well, Royal London had a couple of other questions from people that were along similar lines, I think Robert and Douglas, so hopefully Royal London've answered that for you as well. So, Royal London have another question now which is from Mark and he says, 'Hi, I want to make it easier for my wife if I die first. Is that a good reason to put all my pension pots together?'"}
{"question": "What are the reasons for considering the financial services offered by Royal London?", "answer": "So, I would think, you know, that's a bit-, thinking about almost, like, making admin a bit easier. Now, I think lots of us-, well, I do all the finances in Royal London household, so that was definitely a reason when I was thinking about this that, you know, I kind of thought, 'I do all the finances, if I died tomorrow my husband would have no idea,' so not only did I want to, kind of, write down everything that Royal London had and make sure that he would know but I wanted to, kind of, streamline it a little bit and make sure that he understood. I, you know, there's also reasons why that sometimes, you know, I, I mentioned that the death benefits might not be as good in, in one pension as in another pension, so that's another reason to have a look at it. So, I, I definitely think it's a reason to look at it. It comes back to that, you know, the, the same story, make sure you're not losing any valuable benefits, you know, just double-check everything that there is but, you know, it's, it's certainly a valid reason, to make sure that when the most awful thing happens then life is made a little bit more easy on the admin side."}
{"question": "What is the worth of unclaimed pensions in the UK according to the research conducted by the Pension Policy Institute, and why is it important to track down these lost pensions?", "answer": "There are an estimated 8 million unclaimed pensions in the UK, worth 26.6 billion, according to research by the Pension Policy Institute (PPI)*.

{"question": "Can workplace pensions from previous employers be found easily by simply knowing the name of the company you worked for, like in the case of Royal London?", "answer": "Take a look at your CV. For every job youve had you might have had a workplace pension, and some pensions can be tracked down just by knowing the name of the company you worked for."}
{"question": "What should I do to gather information about my previous pension plans, specifically from providers other than Royal London?", "answer": "Check your files to see if youve got any pension statements from your previous providers. Theyll give you the details of any old plans. The more information you have about your previous plans, the better."}
{"question": "Does having a certificate from a previous employer guarantee pension entitlement at Royal London, even if you received a refund of contributions when leaving the company?", "answer": "Even if you have a certificate from a previous employer, it doesnt always mean that you have a pension entitlement. For example, you may have had a refund of your contributions when you left that employer."}
{"question": "What is a requirement for eligibility for a pension in certain workplace pension schemes offered by a finance company?", "answer": "Many older workplace pensions may have also needed you to be a member for a certain number of years, before you were entitled to a pension."}

{"question": "What benefits does Royal London outline in terms of life insurance and why is it important to have a record of your financial affairs?", "answer": "Yep. So, as you say, there are definitely things to think about that you, you know, to make sure you don't lose valuable benefits, some of the ones that Royal London've outlined but also possibly worth considering, and I think maybe one other thought which is just around death admin, to give it a very, sort of, not very pleasant term. But actually thinking about making life easier for those you leave behind. And I think these days because so many of us live Royal London lives online, certainly Royal London, you know, Royal London financial lives are often online, it's having that record of what you have, so it doesn't obviously mean passwords and things but, you know, accounts that you have and, you know, pensions that you have so that whoever is, is left behind and, and has to sort out the legal and financial affairs at least knows what you had. It's, it's something that I think if you've been through it you realise how useful it is, if you actually know what you're supposed to be dealing with rather than trying to track down things as well. So, that would be maybe just another thing to, to think about. So-,"}
{"question": "What should individuals keep in mind when updating their expression-of-wish forms with a finance company like Royal London to ensure their desired actions are taken upon their death?", "answer": "Yeah. Probably just one point just to mention as well, I take this opportunity that remember to keep your expression-of-wish forms up to date, so it can be called different things for different companies but that's the form when you would say what you would like to happen to your pension when, when you die. So, make sure-, I've often seen these forms that are twenty years out of date so, you know, make sure you put down what you would like to happen. Yeah."}
{"question": "What are some other common names that people might use to refer to Royal London?", "answer": "That's a really good tip. Now, you've said it can be called different things, are there any other common names that people might?"}
{"question": "What are some common types of 'benefit nomination' that one would typically encounter at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah, so sometimes 'benefit nomination', yeah, so you'll just, kind of, see different things. They would probably be the most common that you would see."}
{"question": "What are some considerations for updating pension wishes that people may overlook, especially if they already have a will in place?", "answer": "Yep, and I think it's a really good tip because sometimes people think about updating their will if-, if they have them in the first place, they think about updating their will if their personal circumstances change but because their pension doesn't form part of their will they're not necessarily thinking about updating their pension wishes, so good tip. So, Royal London've had an anonymous question in now which is 'I want to take all of my tax-free cash out when I'm 55 but I don't want to pay any tax as I'm still working. Can I keep different pensions and take all of them?'"}
{"question": "What are the options for individuals who want to access their pensions but only take the tax-free cash, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "So, the answer to that one is if you-, you know, I mentioned that, kind of, drawdown term that if you moved into drawdown then you could take 25% tax-free cash and then leave the rest invested and not take any of that, so you wouldn't be paying any tax because as soon as you start taking income then it does just sit on top of your taxable income-, taxable earnings. So, you know, a lot of people as soon as they can access their pensions will take only their tax-free cash and move the rest into drawdown. Now, you've mentioned keeping different pensions. You can take that from each of them. So, say you have three different pensions, if they all allow moving into drawdown and keeping some of it invested, or it might be that you are taking the tax-free cash and buying an annuity, it, kind of, you know, it depends, but if you're still working then you could take 25% of each of those different pensions. So, they are just three defined-contribution pensions you can take your tax-free cash and then leave the rest invested in drawdown and that means that you just then start taking the income when you stop working or when you need to take it so you're not going to be taxed because you're only going to take the tax-free cash."}
{"question": "\"What steps should be taken to contact the pension provider and provide sufficient information to Royal London for reuniting with your pension savings?\"", "answer": "Once you know which provider your old pension was with, the first step is to contact them.

{"question": "What is the history of Royal London and how many pension providers have become a part of the company since its establishment in 1861?", "answer": "Royal London has been around since 1861, and in that time, a number of pension providers have joined us.

{"question": "Is it advisable to check the Royal London database to determine if any of your missing pensions are associated with one of their providers?", "answer": "So it could be worth having a look at Royal London database to see if any of your missing pensions are with one of those providers."}
{"question": "What steps should be taken to ensure that your previous provider, like Royal London, has your latest contact information to receive important documents?", "answer": "When you speak to your previous provider, its a good idea to make sure they have the most up to date contact details for you.

{"question": "\"Where can I seek assistance in case of a missing pension if I am unable to obtain any relevant details, considering the services provided by Royal London?\"", "answer": "If you think you have a missing pension, but you cant find any information about it at all, you can try the governments free"}
{"question": "What information should be collected about the lost pension before utilizing the Pension Tracing Service, preferably pertaining to Royal London?", "answer": "You should try to collect as much information as you can about the pension you've lost before using the Pension Tracing Service. Ideally, this should include:"}
{"question": "What does the phrase \"tax-free cash\" from Royal London imply?", "answer": "And I think it's just worth maybe, sort of, repeating. So, it might sound obvious but the tax-free cash means what it says on the tin, that is tax-free, and if you just take that it doesn't matter how much you're earning, you're, you're going to not pay tax on it."}
{"question": "What is the alternative method for withdrawing money from pensions that allows you to avoid paying taxes on 75% of the amount, without mentioning a specific finance company?", "answer": "Yes, that's correct. There, there is another way to take money from pensions when you can take a kind of cash lump sum but the problem with taking that is there's 25% that's taxed at zero but the other 75% has to come with it and so then that is taxable income, so that doesn't work if you don't want to be taking that income and if you don't want to be paying tax."}
{"question": "What does it mean when Royal London mentions \"drawdown\" and how does it affect generating income and the tax-free cash?", "answer": "And one other thing you mentioned, you said that if you go into drawdown-, I'm just aware that Royal London're, sort of, throwing around some, some bit of terminology here. So, you said if you go into drawdown, so that's where you can take bits of money to generate an income, for example, that-, but-, and not the tax-free cash, you said it sits on top of your income, so just explain what you mean by that."}
{"question": "How can I minimize the amount of tax I pay while taking income from my pension fund at Royal London?", "answer": "Yes, so if-, say I earned 40,000 a year and I wanted to take my 25% tax-free cash from my 100,000 fund. So, I can take 25,000 but if then I decided to take some income then and if I wanted to take, say, 15,000 and that 15,000 is going to sit on top of my 40,000 of earnings, so it's going to be putting me into the higher-rate tax bracket, which probably is not what I want to be doing. Normally you want to be, kind of, making sure you're paying the least tax possible, so that's what happens. As soon as you start taking the, kind of, income amount off that then you're going to be taxed on it. Now, you don't have to take if you've got 100,000 in your pension fund, you don't have to take 25,000 and then leave the rest invested. You can, sort of, take a little bit of tax-free cash at a time, so you could maybe take-, Royal London'll have, sort of, 10,000 of tax-free cash just now and some of that money moves into drawdown. Or you can, you know, just, kind of, work it out like that and it depends if you're working, if you're not working what you want to do."}
{"question": "Can individuals choose not to withdraw the full 25% tax-free amount at once from a financial company like Royal London?", "answer": "Yes, so it's important to say just because you can take 25% tax-free, you don't have to take that in one go."}
{"question": "Can I transfer money from my current pension to a different pension plan with Royal London?", "answer": "Okay. So, Royal London've got another question that's come in from Lisa who says, 'Can I transfer money from pensions to a pension that I'm no longer paying into?'"}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when assessing different pensions, such as those offered by Royal London, and comparing them on a like-for-like basis?", "answer": "So, yes, it's just about assessing the different pensions and looking what they all offer, so perhaps there is a pension that you think-, so, you know, it's perhaps one you've had in the past and you think, 'Well, actually that offers me something that the pension I'm in currently doesn't offer.' As long as that pension is still open-, so if it's an older pension scheme sometimes they do shut them so you just have to, kind of, check that that's still available. Also if it's a bit older, are the charges higher? So, it's just about looking and trying to compare the different pensions on a, kind of, like-for-like basis. What are the charges? What does that offer that I'm not getting just now? But as long as the pension scheme will accept that money then you can move into it."}
{"question": "What would be the procedure to obtain information about the closure of older-style pensions at Royal London?", "answer": "And this may sound like a stupid question but you mentioned that some of the older-style pensions, they may have closed, would you have been told about that, is that something you'd know about or would you just find out if you asked if you could transfer?"}
{"question": "What database does Royal London's Pension Tracing Service use to search for lost workplace or personal pensions, and can it provide contact details for these pensions, including any information about companies or providers that may have taken over or changed names?", "answer": "The Pension Tracing Service can then use this information to search through their database of over 300,000 pensions and may be able to give you the contact details for a workplace pension or personal pension you've lost touch with. This includes details of the new company or provider name if your old pension has been taken over or changed its name over the years."}
{"question": "What is the role of Royal London in assisting with pension inquiries and payouts?", "answer": "The Pension Tracing Service will only tell you the contact details of the pensions administrator. You'll then need to contact the pension administrator to find out whether you have a pension, what value it is and to ask for it to be paid out."}
{"question": "What are the options to consider when deciding what to do with lost track pensions, particularly in relation to Royal London?", "answer": "Once youve found the pensions youve lost track of and have all their details, you can decide what youd like to do with them. These are some of the options to think about."}
{"question": "How can consolidating your pension savings with a single company facilitate better tracking and retirement planning?", "answer": "Bringing all your pension savings together could make it easier to keep track of them and plan for the retirement you want."}
{"question": "Who does Royal London suggest speaking to if individuals are unsure about the best option for them and do not have a financial adviser?", "answer": "If youre not sure what the best option for you is, Royal London recommend speaking to a financial adviser. If you dont already have an adviser you can find one in your area."}
{"question": "What are some possible reasons for a finance company to close, especially when considering defined-contribution plans, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "Yes. You normally would have been told because they would really say, 'Royal London're no longer accepting contributions,' and the reason they might have closed is because they actually setup a new, kind of, auto-enrolment, perhaps a new workplace pension scheme that just works a bit differently or perhaps that provider has been taken over by another provider. There's lots of reasons why they might close. Now, I am talking about the defined-contribution world here so that is when Royal London're thinking about those pots of money, and if it's a defined-benefit pension that you're mentioning then defined-benefit schemes will not allow any money to be paid into them, most of these schemes are closed. If it's a public-sector scheme then you can't transfer any money into that. So, you know, when I'm answering that question, I should have made that clear probably earlier, it is thinking about that defined contribution, that pot of money that you grow that I'm talking about there."}
{"question": "Can individuals transfer their defined-contribution pots into a pension plan at Royal London?", "answer": "So, the earlier example Royal London mentioned, sort of, almost at the start of the webinar of the, kind of, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher. If you had a pension there you couldn't transfer your, sort of, defined-contribution pots into that kind of pension?"}
{"question": "Can individuals transfer their pension funds from a defined-contribution scheme to a public sector scheme like Royal London, even if they switch to a different public-sector role?", "answer": "No, you can-, you can transfer it. Say, you're a teacher, you can move into another public-sector scheme sometimes if you move to a different part of the public sector but not-, you cannot transfer from one of these kind of pots, like defined-contribution schemes, into a public sector. And also for private sector DB schemes then most of them will not accept any money in. That would just be, kind of, standard practice."}
{"question": "What is the fate of my pension pot if I don't have a partner or children? Can I designate beneficiaries, or does it cease to exist upon my death?", "answer": "Yeah. Great stuff, thank you. So, Royal London've had an anonymous question which is, 'What would happen to my pension pot when I die as I don't have a partner or children? Does it just die with me or can I allocate beneficiaries?'"}
{"question": "What options do individuals have when nominating beneficiaries to receive benefits from their defined-contribution pot at Royal London?", "answer": "So, again, if Royal London're thinking about this defined-contribution world where you've got this pot of cash then you would nominate-, in that form I mentioned, you would say who you would want to receive the benefits. So, that could be anyone. You can pick whoever you would like to receive the benefits. It can be an individual, it can be a trust. It has to be a living person or a trust, though I have seen someone's dog be nominated and that is not allowable. So, (talking over each other 35.21)."}
{"question": "What important considerations should one keep in mind while updating their expression-of-wish form for a modern workplace pension, such as the one offered by Royal London?", "answer": "I know. I know. You would have to nominate someone to look after your dogs if, if that was the case but yeah. So, you can choose who would receive them. Now, the only thing I would say is that sometimes when you're in an older workplace pension scheme there are scenarios where it's only a spouse or a partner who'd benefit on your death, and that fund would be used to buy an annuity for them. So, double-check, because death benefits are important to people. If it's a kind of modern scheme you'll have the full choice that the law allows but some older schemes, they had the, the, the capacity to change, the law allowed them to change, but it was kind of easier for them to, to run as they did. So, it might be the case that if you didn't have a partner or children, then it wouldn't go to anyone. So, double-check what type of pension it is, you know, but if it's a modern kind of it's a workplace pension, for example, that your employer pays into, normally they would allow that pension pot to be paid to anyone, so you would just choose. So, it's really important to keep your expression-of-wish form up to date though."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the Pensions Dashboard developed by Royal London in assisting individuals in finding their old pensions, and when can we expect its implementation?", "answer": "So, thanks Clare. So, Royal London've got a question from Janelle who says, 'Will the Pensions Dashboard help people locate old pensions and when will it go live?'"}
{"question": "When is Royal London planning to launch the pensions tool?", "answer": "So, it should be able to help, that's the idea is that actually people are going to be able to see what pensions they have and it's, you know, also going to have the state pension as well on it. So, it should be a really useful tool for people to see in, kind of, a snapshot what will happen. When will it go live? Well, that's probably a good question. I think Royal London're looking at it starting to go live from 2023. It depends and not-, you won't see everything on it to begin with, so larger pensions will go on that first, especially if you, you know, are, kind of, have public-sector pensions for example then, you know, they'll be going on but you might find if you're in a, a kind of smaller, perhaps an old private-sector defined-benefit scheme then that might take a couple of years longer to go on, for example."}
{"question": "\"During the phased roll out of the Pensions Dashboard, will Royal London be providing more publicity and information about it prior to the official launch next year?\"", "answer": "Yep, so I think it's important to say it's kind of going to be a bit of a phased roll out, isn't it? So, you're not necessarily going to see everything from day one, but Royal London will probably start seeing more publicity about it ahead of the, the beginning of the roll out next year, so I think Royal London'll, Royal London'll definitely be hearing and seeing a bit more about the Pensions Dashboard. So, thanks for your question, Janelle. I've got a question now from Paul who wants to know, 'Can I transfer a pot worth over 30,000 from another pension provider?' So, I think this is going over something that Royal London talked about pretty much at the start of the webinar."}
{"question": "Does Royal London require financial advice for transferring defined-contribution workplace pension schemes?", "answer": "Yes. So, that's-, so, yes but if you are transferring it and it had some of these, these benefits, so Royal London mentioned this scenario where it was a, a defined-benefit scheme, if it was over 30,000, or if it had a guaranteed annuity rate, then you would need to take financial advice. If it's not, if it's just another, say, workplace pension scheme that's defined-contribution, so it's that pot of money, then you wouldn't need to take financial advice, so you can just move that quite easily."}
{"question": "How can one determine whether the assistance of a financial advisor is necessary when examining the paperwork or contacting the pension provider in order to learn about the valuable benefits associated with a defined-contribution pot of money, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "Okay and two things to say on that, so you mentioned if it was this, this pot of money, a defined-contribution, an older-style one where it might have valuable benefits. So, is that something that, you know, you would be able to find out by looking at the paperwork or ringing the pension provider, or is that something a financial advisor-, how would you know whether you would need the financial advisor in the first place or could you just not do the transfer?"}
{"question": "What should be done if the paperwork or provider does not explicitly mention the necessary information about a particular company?", "answer": "That's a great point. Your paperwork should be able to tell you, if it doesn't tell you then the provider will be able to tell you, so it's worth giving them a phone to find out."}
{"question": "Can Royal London facilitate the transfer of pensions into an active pension pot?", "answer": "Great stuff. Well, thanks for the question Paul. Michelle has asked a question saying, 'I have two pensions that I no longer contribute to, can I transfer them into an active pension pot?'"}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when comparing charges for defined-contribution pensions, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah, so I think that's, you know, what Royal London've just covered. It depends what type of pensions, if they are just defined-contribution pensions with no guarantees then you can easily move them into your other pension pot but, you know, back to what Royal London said at the beginning, make sure you're not losing any valuable benefits, make sure you're comparing the charges. If your active pension pot is likely to be, you know, especially that will be if it's a workplace scheme then, you know, it has to be under that 0.75% for the default fund. It might be the other two pensions you've got are personal pensions, they might be higher charges, so it could save money on charges moving into the new one, but just double-check what those two pensions are. So, again, just look at your paperwork, if it's not clear phone up the provider, they will be more than used to dealing with questions on this."}
{"question": "What is the minimum age requirement for transferring pensions at Royal London?", "answer": "Great stuff. Okay. Thank you for that, Michelle. And Royal London've got another question which is from Sally saying-, and she asks, 'Do I have to be over the age of 55 to transfer my pensions?'"}
{"question": "Can you transfer your pension at any age, including before reaching 55, and does this apply to Royal London as well?", "answer": "No. So, you can transfer your pension at any point in, in time. You don't have to be over 55, you just have to be over 55 to be able to take money out of your pensions, so your tax-free cash or to start any-, taking any income. So, that's-, that-, what that 55, which will be 57 in 2028. So, again, that's not something that I think is-, you know, Royal London've seen some stuff in the press about it but it's one to be aware of for the younger people who are listening that they might not be able to access until 55 but for transferring, you can transfer at any age. So, if you are 25 and you've, you know, you've moved to your second job then you can move the pot of money you had from your first job, for example."}
{"question": "Can I transfer my pension pot from the old workplace-pension provider to the new provider if my employer changed the provider?", "answer": "And it is just probably worth reminding people about one of the benefits that you said it was a good idea to check about which is the age at which you can take your pension, as you mentioned there the age being 55, rising to 57 by 2028, but with some pensions they may have slightly different rules so, again, just a reminder to check not just charges and investment choice but also the age-, the-, and the valuable benefits but also the age at which you can take your pension. So, a really good question. Thanks very much, Sally. So, onto the next question which is from Allison and she'd like to know, 'If my employer changed the workplace-pension provider, can I transfer my pot from the old workplace-pension provider to the new provider?'"}
{"question": "What should you do if your employer is changing the pension provider?", "answer": "So, if your employer is changing the pension provider then that's-, they're kind of moving everybody from, from one provider to the other, so it's the employer setup the scheme and it's just the provider that's changing, so you shouldn't actually have to, kind of, physically do anything in, in, in, you know, in that situation but they should be giving you information. So, your employer will be talking about, kind of, what's happening and what this process means for you. So, I'd have a look at anything that's coming out paperwork-wise just so you know, kind of, what's happening."}
{"question": "Can you suggest where to find a financial advisor recommended by Royal London?", "answer": "Okay, thank you. So, Royal London've got an anonymous question, I, I think it's a really good one as well though which is, 'Where can I find a financial advisor?' So, do you want to make a start on that one, Clare?"}
{"question": "What are some organizations and websites that can help me find a local financial advisor that I can trust?", "answer": "Yes, so, I mean, there is different places you can look, there's different things like, kind of, Unbiased, there's different organisations you can look at to try and find a financial advisor who's use local to you, you know, it's worth doing, you know, kind of, researching this because-, and, and even meeting up with some people. Because if you're going to get financial advice they are going to look at all of your life, you want to build up a relationship, this could be someone that you're going to see for a long time. So, actually spending the time and finding someone that, you know, actually you can kind of like and you trust then that's important. But I do know it feels tricky sometimes, people are like, 'Well, I don't know anyone,' but it's good to sometimes ask friends and family as well but there are different sites that you can use to try and find a, a, a financial advisor as well."}
{"question": "What are some websites and directories mentioned by the paragraph where someone can find a financial advisor other than Royal London?", "answer": "Yep, and you mentioned Unbiased, that's one website and there are-, there are other places that you can find a financial advisor, so I think it depends a bit on what you're looking for and maybe what stage of your life you're at. So, the MoneyHelper has a, a directory of advisors who specialise in retirement, there's another website I think called VouchedFor which is-, has reviews of customers of, of providers and I think the Personal Finance Society has its own directory. Now, Royal London've got an article on RoyalLondon.com which talks about where to find a financial advisor and also there's one that talks about the kind of things to think about before you see an advisor. And you mentioned, Clare, about, you know, meeting or talking to and advisor and why it's important to do that, and I agree, I think it's something that, you know, it's not the kind of thing that most of us do very regularly and it can be a little bit daunting but I think it's a good idea to, sort of, think about the kind of questions you want to ask and, sort of, maybe treat it a bit like a job interview because, as you say, you could be having this professional relationship with somebody for a very long time and you could be telling them quite, you know, quite personal stuff about what you think about money, what your goals are, what your aspirations are, as well as how you spend your money. So, definitely spend a bit of time talking to the advisor and getting a feel for them as well as, sort of, looking at things like, you know, sort of, the areas they specialise in. That would be my, my, my tip. Okay, Royal London've had-,"}
{"question": "What should a couple consider when looking for a financial advisor at Royal London?", "answer": "I, I was just going to say that if you're a couple looking for financial advice, it's important that the two of you actually, kind of, find someone you're both happy with because, you know, if-, when the death of a partner happens your financial advisor can take on loads of the admin involved in dealing with things like death and, and other things that have to be done but you want to make sure it's someone that both of you trust and both of you feel comfortable. So, I think that's really important, kind of, on a family basis to have someone, not just someone who, kind of, you know, one person likes or trusts."}
{"question": "What is the situation regarding transferring to old pension schemes if they are more beneficial, according to Royal London?", "answer": "I think that's a really good tip, even if one of you tends to take a bit more of a lead in certain areas of finance because Royal London often find that, you know, maybe couples divide the kind of financial side of things. So, even if you're a bit less involved, for example, it's still important to go along, so a really good tip. So, Royal London've had another question, this one is from Seraphine and-, who wants to know, 'Can you transfer only to your current pension scheme or can you transfer to old schemes if they're more beneficial?' So, I think Royal London've, sort of, covered this in one of the earlier questions but I think it's really worth reiterating as well because this is important stuff to get right. So, what's the situation, Clare?"}
{"question": "Is it possible to transfer pensions to schemes offered by Royal London if it is deemed more beneficial?", "answer": "So, if schemes are open then you can normally transfer to them, so that's, you know-, and when I say schemes I just mean pensions. So, it's just about checking that if it is going to be more beneficial, if you think it is more beneficial, then they just have to be able to accept the money, so that's it."}
{"question": "What are some of the topics discussed by the finance company regarding charges, options at retirement, tax-free cash, investments, and pension withdrawal age?", "answer": "And just, just to recap on some of the things Royal London talked about, so Royal London talked about charges, Royal London talked about options at retirement, tax-free cash, investments, and the age at which you can take your pension, I think."}
{"question": "What factors should individuals consider to safeguard their benefits, including guaranteed annuity rate and loyalty bonuses, when seeking financial advice or considering a transfer?", "answer": "And then also you mentioned some of the areas that people need to look at to make sure they're not gonna lose those benefits, you mentioned the guaranteed annuity rate and also the loyalty bonuses were a couple that, that you mentioned. So, definitely worth doing all those checks or talking to a financial advisor even if you can transfer, so-,"}
{"question": "How does Royal London handle situations where a customer wants to transfer their pensions but still ends up with more than one scheme?", "answer": "Yeah and you don't need to move, you know, say you've got six pots you don't have to move them into one pot, that's, you know, it's, it's not about doing that either. Sometimes you can actually-, you know, if you decide, 'Well, actually I quite want, kind of, money in this for this reason or I want it-, and sometimes you have to, in certain scenarios-, to do with those valuable benefits I spoke about, sometimes you have to open a new pension scheme, which is just the way, kind of, the law works. So, there are situations where even if you decide to, you know, to transfer your pensions perhaps because it's going to make the admin better, the charges might be lower, you might still end up with not just one scheme but you might end up just with, you know, a couple of pensions."}
{"question": "What types of pensions can be grouped together at Royal London, specifically in relation to NHS/council pensions?", "answer": "Okay, good stuff. So, Royal London had a question from Michelle. Again, I think Royal London may have covered this but it's always worth reiterating, which is, 'What type of pensions can be grouped together? As in-, and, and she says, 'NHS/council pensions.' So, I guess that's, kind of, which kinds of, sort of, the similar, similar kind of pension."}
{"question": "What are the different types of pension schemes offered by Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah, so when Royal London think about NHS and council pensions, they come under that umbrella of public-sector pension schemes and so I would, kind of, think about them as a group and then Royal London've got private-sector defined-benefit schemes which are similar in that they've got that kind of promise to pay. You won't find many of them open anymore but you might have them from the past. And then Royal London've got defined contribution which is, you know, most modern schemes, most people starting a job now that's what you would have, you pay in, your employer pays in, of course you get the benefits of tax relief as well, and then at the time you start taking pensions it's up to you to manage how you take that money out to last until you-, until you die or until your spouse dies or how-, you know, what you would like to happen. So, that's kind of how I would think of them in, kind of, groupings. When I spoke about the public sector, just as a reminder, most public-sector schemes you cannot transfer money out of them, they are not funded, there's no pot of money that can leave the scheme so that's not how it works. You'd, you'd stay in those, so even if you leave-, say you are a doctor in the NHS and you stop working in the NHS and you go to be a doctor in the private sector then your NHS pension is still there, it doesn't go away and you can access it at retirement, but you can't move it anywhere else because of it being in that. If you've got a council or a local government scheme then theoretically you could move it but that promise to pay is, you know, it's a very valuable benefit so that's, you know, and you have to take financial advice on it, and actually for most people having a guaranteed benefit like that which goes up every year is worth its weight in gold."}
{"question": "Can I transfer the money I receive from my ex-husband's pension into my work pension at Royal London when I retire?", "answer": "Yeah, good point. So, Royal London've had another question which is, 'I got divorced from my husband and I get some money every month from his pension. When I stop work, can I move that money into my other work pension?'"}
{"question": "What are the options for dividing pensions during a divorce and how does it typically work at Royal London?", "answer": "So, this is an interesting one and it opens up a huge can of worms about divorce which I could go on about for ages and you really don't want to hear me talking about that at length now. I think from, from this question it looks like that when you got divorced there was an arrangement setup and it would have been called an 'attachment order' or an 'earmarking order' that you would get, say, for example, 50% of your ex-husband's pension when he retired, and so every month money comes into your bank and that's from his pension. Now, legally he still owns that pension, you're just getting some of that money out, so you can have that-, you know, move that into your other pension. But even if it was a different type of way in which pensions are dealt with on divorce, called pensions sharing, that-, what happens then is you, you would own the pension, so you would say get 50% of the fund, so that pot of money, and you can do, you know, what-, you move it to where you want it to be and then when you take it, at age 55 or whenever, it's up to you to, you know, to choose. But there are complications with pensions. So, you can't just maybe move it into the same pot if there's been a divorce, just because the way, kind of, the technicality of how it all works. So, it would normally not be able to move it into the same pension as your other, but you can move it to the same provider but it probably will notionally be held in a- in a separate type account."}
{"question": "What is the significance of Royal London in the automatic enrolment into pensions process?", "answer": "Okay, great. Great stuff. And I say, I know that you know a lot about pensions and divorce, and maybe that's a subject for another-, for another, another webinar another day but anyway. Let's go to another question which is from Laura, and she wants to know what year did automatic enrolment into pensions begin. So, I'll kick-off with this one. So, it's coming up to it's tenth anniversary because it actually started being phased in from October 2012, but that was, like, the biggest employers who first started automatically enrolling their employees and then it moved over a period of years through to the smallest employers and, you know, and new employers. So, it's been with us for a while but I guess, Clare, it's really in the last, sort of, six years or so that it's, kind of, got more momentum because Royal London've had, you know, Royal London've, Royal London've-, well, Royal London've had millions of people automatically enrolled."}
{"question": "How has auto-enrolment impacted Royal London's pension scheme and what changes does Royal London expect to see in the future?", "answer": "Definitely and Royal London can see that auto-enrolment has been a big success. Royal London've got more people paying into pensions than ever and that's really great news because, you know, Royal London all have a retirement income need and when Royal London retire Royal London need to be able to have some money so that Royal London can enjoy Royal London retirement and, you know, in Royal London last session Royal London kind of spoke about that idea of thinking what you would like to have in your retirement and making sure that you're saving enough into pensions, so auto-enrolment has really helped with that. And it will be interesting to see what happens over the next few years. I think there will probably be some changes to auto-enrolment. It might start when people are younger, just now that it, it, kind of, is 22 so perhaps Royal London'll see it at 18. So, I think Royal London will see some changes but I think Royal London can all agree that it has been really great."}
{"question": "Can Wayne transfer his three old pensions to his current NHS pension at Royal London?", "answer": "Yep. Royal London were talking about the faff factor earlier on in terms of having lots of different pensions around but, you know, there was a bit of a faff factor before, certainly for some people of, of signing up for a pension in the first place and, as you say, automatic enrolment has sort of taken that away. You don't actually have to do anything active, although obviously you can leave if you want to. But you are put into your workplace pension scheme as long as you, kind of, meet the qualifying criteria and, as you say, that sort of changed the saving habits of, of millions of people. So, okay, I think Royal London've got time for just a couple more questions or, or, or one or two. Royal London'll see how Royal London go with the answers, Clare. No pressure. So, again, Royal London've got another one which is about NHS, so Royal London may have covered this but I think it's always good to reiterate. So, there's a question from Wayne saying he has three old pensions, he now works for the NHS and has a current NHS pension, can he transfer it to the NHS pension?"}
{"question": "Is it possible to transfer a public-sector pension to Royal London if one has three older pensions that are not public-sector pensions?", "answer": "So, the answer is probably no because it is a public-sector pension, it's really unlikely, and especially because they're older pensions that I mentioned that sometime you can move other public sector pensions, it's-, there's kind of a light limited time frame. It's something called 'the transfer club', so if it is, kind of, public-sector pensions and you're within a certain time then it's worth asking, phoning up the NHS pension, or if you're in Scotland the SPPA who'd be the people that would send you out the literature. But I think if there are three older pensions and they weren't public-sector pensions, then the answer is probably no for that one."}
{"question": "What is the process to check the amount paid in at Royal London so that I can determine the transferable amount?", "answer": "Okay. Royal London'll sneak in one last question as Royal London're-, as Royal London're coming up to the end of the-, of Royal London time. So, it's from Maria who says, 'I started to work at a company in January, I previously worked for nine years until 2016. How do I check the amount paid in so I know how much I can transfer?'"}
{"question": "What steps should I take to retrieve information about my pension balance and potential transfer options if I have an older pension from a previous employer, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "So, you should get an annual statement every year which will say how much money you have in a pension, so even when you're no longer actively a member of that pension scheme every year you'll have to get information out. You might be able to have an app that shows you how much so you can just go in and look at how much you've got in that pension but if it's an older pension that you've, you know, you worked in for a while you might need to get in touch with the pension provider. If you can find any literature that's got the name of the pension provider and you know the name of the employer then you can give them a phone, ask how much you've got and then you can ask about transferring as well."}
{"question": "What topics would you like Royal London to cover in future webinars?", "answer": "Great stuff. Well, thank you very much. That is all Royal London have time for in today's webinar. Thanks so much for all your questions and for taking part in the polls. It's really appreciated. Thanks Clare very much for answering all the questions. Royal London have recorded the webinar and that will be available online and Royal London'll be sharing the link with you very soon. Do let us know about other topics that you'd like us, like us to cover in future webinars because Royal London're keen to make sure that the webinars cover topics you're interested in but for now thanks very much for joining us today."}
{"question": "What insights do the pensions experts from a respected finance company share about saving for retirement?", "answer": "Hear Royal London pensions experts Sarah Pennells and Clare Moffat discuss how much you should be saving now for the lifestyle you might want in retirement. This session was recorded on 2 March 2022."}
{"question": "What is Clare Moffat's role at the finance company hosting today's webinar?", "answer": "Hi everyone, Im Clare Moffat, and my job at Royal London is to help explain how pensions work. Welcome to Royal London webinar today."}
{"question": "What associations do you have with the concept of retirement, especially in relation to a finance company like Royal London?", "answer": "If I say the word retirement to you, what comes to mind? Maybe its the luxury of not having to work to pay your bills and being able to spend time doing what you want to do. Or maybe its something that feels a long way away, that old people do and, frankly, it doesnt feel very relevant to you."}
{"question": "How does Royal London plan to finance its retirement years, considering the increasing life expectancy compared to previous generations?", "answer": "Well, the good news I hope is that because were living longer than Royal London parents and grandparents, Royal London could spend 20 years or longer in retirement. But of course, the big question is, how do Royal London pay for it?"}
{"question": "What steps do you need to take in order to achieve your dream of retiring at a certain age or spending your retirement years seeing the world, specifically with regards to Royal London's services?", "answer": "You might have the dream or hope of retiring at a certain age, or of spending your retirement years seeing the world. But have you ever taken a step back to look at what you have to do in order to achieve that dream?"}
{"question": "How does Royal London recommend individuals determine the adequate amount to save for an early retirement or a desired post-retirement lifestyle?", "answer": "Now while the majority of people will have a pension they pay into on a monthly basis, have you ever actually looked into how much you should be saving if you wanted to retire early or to afford a certain lifestyle when you do retire?"}
{"question": "What kind of pension questions can Royal London address during this webinar?", "answer": "Now today Im delighted to be joined by Royal London consumer finance specialist, Sarah Pennells, to discuss just that. Now Ive got quite a few questions that I am going to ask Sarah to get the ball rolling, but then weve got some time at the end to answer your questions so please type these into the Q and A box at the side. Now Royal London cant answer any specific Royal London queries in this webinar, but Royal London can deal with general pension questions you have."}
{"question": "What financial issues does the consumer finance specialist at Royal London address on a day-to-day basis?", "answer": "Yes, so Im the consumer finance specialist at Royal London and what that means is that I look at the kind of financial issues that affect people day to day. So at the moment Im looking a lot at the cost of living rises, so the huge hike in energy bills due to come in April, inflation, interest rates, the rise in National Insurance and so on. But I could also be looking at things like the impact of climate change and how that might affect Royal London lifestyle in retirement if Royal London end up having really hot summers or Royal London homes are at increased risk of flooding and looking at what Royal London could possibly do about that now. So thats a mixture of talking to customers through webinars like this, through Royal London customer newsletter, through content on Royal London website but also doing media interviews so talking on TV, radio and the press."}
{"question": "What is the starting point for Royal London when it comes to discussing retirement?", "answer": "Thanks Sarah. So today were talking about retirement. It feels like a bit of a big topic. So where do Royal London start with it?"}
{"question": "What are the reasons why people might be hesitant to take the first step in retirement planning, considering the perception of it being a daunting topic and its apparent distance from the present?", "answer": "It is one of those things I think can seem quite daunting because as you say, it is a really big topic. And I think thats one of the reasons why people dont maybe take that first step. And I think the other issue is that retirement can seem so far away it can seem like something that you dont need to start thinking about now."}
{"question": "\"What are some effective strategies to envision and plan for one's desired retirement lifestyle, especially in terms of financial considerations, without solely focusing on numbers, taking inspiration from personal experiences or preferences, considering the case of Royal London?\"", "answer": "But there are a couple of things firstly I would really start to think about the lifestyle you want in retirement. So, really start to imagine how youre going to live your life in retirement. What are you going to be doing and how are you going to pay for it? So that youre starting to kind of picture that life. Now Im a real fan of writing things down and thinking, okay, how do I want to spend my time, what will I spend my days and weeks doing? And then starting to work out what you think those things might cost. And I think it makes it a bit easier to - well it makes it easier for me anyway! It makes it easier for some people to start thinking about retirement like that rather than for example starting with the numbers. Which, you know, for some people can be a bit dry, a bit of a turn off."}
{"question": "What kind of financial assistance does Royal London provide to individuals who become ill and are unable to work?", "answer": "If you fall ill and have to stop work for a period of time or altogether, you may have problems making ends meet. If you are employed, you are usually entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for up to 28 weeks and possibly extra sick pay from your employer. If you are self-employed, you will have to rely on state benefits and any savings you have."}
{"question": "What is the foundation of retirement income for those interested in numbers and starting with a pension plan, specifically focusing on the state pension, for individuals associated with a certain finance company?", "answer": "Thats a really good point. So there are some people for who numbers really do it for them, and in which case I think its a question of starting with what you know youre going to get for retirement if you dont have any other kind o pension. So you know for us, the foundation of Royal London retirement income is going to be the state pension. So therefore its looking at what youre going to get from your state pension."}
{"question": "What is the amount of money that someone entitled to the maximum state pension, with a full national insurance record, would receive annually from a finance company named after the UK's capital city?", "answer": "So for somebody whos retiring today whos entitled to the maximum amount so theyve got the full national insurance record, the amount of money that they would get by way of the state pension is 9,339 a year. Now thats an amount that youll get per person. Not that works out at around 778 a month."}
{"question": "What age grouping would you like Royal London to consider when collecting retirement preferences?", "answer": "Thanks Sarah. So at this point id like us to do a poll. Now thats beside the Q and A tab. No one will know how youve voted by please do tell us what you think. so the first question is at what age would you like to retire? And theres some options that youll see there. So please think about kind of that age grouping that you would like to have a look at, and Royal London can see some of the numbers starting to come in. thats moving about a bit Sarah."}
{"question": "What are the insights gained from observing people's voting patterns and retirement age preferences at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah it is, its really interesting actually seeing how people are voting and the kind of ages that people want to retire at. So I think well just keep it moving for a minute or two because people are still carrying on voting. A minute feels like a long time! Maybe not a minute or two!"}
{"question": "Can we review the numbers for Royal London quickly now that everything seems to have settled down?", "answer": "Okay, it seems to have settled down so shall Royal London have a quick, do you want to have a quick run though the numbers?"}
{"question": "Why did the finance company inquire about retirement preferences, Sarah?", "answer": "Yeah so at the top weve got 63-65. Oh no! thats just changed on my screen, 59 to 63. So weve got some people who have just voted who want to retire when theyre younger. Then 63 to 65, followed by 55 to 58, 66 to 68 and theres not many people, only 5% so far, who would want to retire at 69 plus. So, Sarah, why have Royal London asked this question?"}
{"question": "What company's State Pension age is being discussed in the paragraph?", "answer": "Well the reason I was keen to get a poll of what people thought is to link it to the State Pension age. So the last time I looked at this only 12% of people said they wanted to retire between 66 and 68 and the most popular answer was 59 to 62 and I think it was 63 to 65, those were about 29/30% each. But you dont get your State Pension until youre 66."}
{"question": "What implications does the increasing State Pension age by 2028 and further rise to 68 in the future have on retirement planning for individuals, specifically regarding their financial needs and savings, without explicitly mentioning the finance company associated with these changes?", "answer": "So for people retiring at the moment the earliest they can claim their State Pension is 66. And that State Pension age is due to rise, so its going up to 67 by 2028 and its due to go up to 68 in a few years after that. So unless youre happy to wait until you get your State Pension I think thats also going to skew how you then think about how much money you need in your retirement and therefore what you need to save each month."}
{"question": "What should people prioritize when considering their retirement: the desired age or the lifestyle they aspire to, according to this financial company?", "answer": "And thats really important. But Sarah, should people be focussing on the age they want to retire or the type of lifestyle they'd like to live?"}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when determining the amount one needs to save each month for retirement, considering the desired lifestyle, hobbies, travel, dining out, car ownership, and home improvement?", "answer": "Well I think both really. I guess lifestyle is possibly more important in a way, in that the kind of lifestyle that you want at retirement is going to probably have a bigger impact on how much you need to save every month. So you know, if youre the kind of person whos thinking, you know when youre picturing your retirement, youre thinking I want to take up new hobbies. I want to travel abroad. I want to eat out a lot. I want to be able to do those things. I maybe want to have a car or what to do up my home."}
{"question": "What is the significance of considering one's lifestyle when planning for retirement according to the paragraph provided?", "answer": "Well, your retirement in terms of its cost is going to look very different from somebody else who thinks actually Im quite happy with a fairly modest income in retirement. I dont need or want to do those things. Im not interested in eating out. I dont want to run a car, that kind of thing. So thats why I think thinking about your lifestyle is so important."}

Whether youre paying your rent or mortgage. Similarly in retirement its really important to think about where youre going to live.

And obviously if youre renting are you going to be renting the same, similar kind of property to the one you live in at the moment or maybe somewhere thats a bit cheaper."}
{"question": "What factors related to the cost of living and household bills should be taken into account for Royal London?", "answer": "I mentioned the cost of living right at the start and household bills.

{"question": "How can Royal London assist in managing your finances effectively during periods of ill health?", "answer": "Your income is likely to fall if you have to stop work due to ill health. To make sure your money goes as far as you need it to its a good idea to review your spending. You could start by making a list of all the things you have to pay for. Prioritise your bills and any other essentials such as food. Next think about the other things you spend money on. Keeping a spending diary is a good way to keep track of where your money goes."}
{"question": "How might your spending patterns change now that you have retired, considering factors such as the elimination of commuting and lunch expenses, but potential increased heating bills while being at home more?", "answer": "Once you have a full list of all your spending think about how this might change now that you have stopped work. For example, while you may no longer have to pay to get to work and for lunches, your heating bills may go up if you are at home more."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of envisioning your lifestyle in retirement, and why is this approach particularly advocated by Royal London?", "answer": "Now I mentioned about sort of picturing your lifestyle in retirement and why I think thats a really good starting point. And one of the things I also meant to mention is that instead of thinking about retirement as this concept of something you drift in to when you end your working life, one way to flip it which really worked for me when I started thinking about my retirement quite a few years ago, was thinking about it being the age that you no longer have to work, to pay your bills."}
{"question": "What is one aspect that gets you excited about planning for retirement at Royal London?", "answer": "Now I love my job, and Im not just sating that because some of my colleagues are listening, but I dont really think I want to retire in a few years time. I want to carry on working. But something that does get me quite excited in terms of thinking about my lifestyle at retirement is thinking about the age that I can stop, I can afford to stop work, I can still pay my bills without having to work."}
{"question": "What is the importance of considering both lifestyle and retirement plans when it comes to Royal London?", "answer": "And so that leads me onto the second part and the part Royal London were just talking about as a result of that poll. When do you want to retire? It doesnt have to be the same as giving up work. But when do you want to have that freedom to stop work, if thats what you want to do? And does that tie up with when youre going to get the State Pension? Which is going to be 66 for people retiring now, could be 67, 68, possibly even later for people who are younger. So thats how Id think about it. And thats why I think both lifestyle and when you want to retire are really important."}

{"question": "What are the three different categories of retirement lifestyles that independent researchers from Loughborough University have identified in the information provided by Royal London?", "answer": "and weve put the details in the link below. And that website has information about sort of the kind of retirement you might want, and it puts a figure on it. And the research has been done by independent researchers from Loughborough University and theyve come up with three different categories of how much people might need or want to live on in retirement depending on the kind of lifestyle theyd like."}
{"question": "What is the estimated minimum annual income required by Royal London to maintain a basic standard of living in retirement?", "answer": "So the least popular option form Royal London poll was one where its minimum standards of living in retirement. And for that the researchers reckon that youll need 10,900 a year. And for that youll be able to do things like eat out once in a while. Youll be able to have a holiday in the UK, spend about 40 a week on food shopping, about 40 a month on clothes and shoes. But you wouldnt, for example, be able to afford to run a car."}
{"question": "What is the amount needed for a comfortable retirement lifestyle according to Royal London for a single person living alone?", "answer": "Now at the other end of the spectrum, at the other extreme, the researchers have looked at what they call a comfortable lifestyle. And in that case you would have to have about 33,600 if you wanted to have a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. And these figures are both for somebody who, a single person, someone living on their own."}
{"question": "What financial options does Royal London offer for individuals to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle, including dining out, taking vacations, and upgrading their homes and cars periodically?", "answer": "Now for this lifestyle as with the poll, was sort of first option that was not surprisingly very popular, you would be able to eat out in a decent restaurant one a week, have takeaways, go on these holidays abroad. Youd also be able to do up your home. Have a new kitchen of bathroom every 10 or 15 years or so. And youd be able to have a car as well."}
{"question": "Which free debt organizations can one contact for assistance in prioritizing debt repayment?", "answer": "Start paying off your priority debts first. If you have difficulty doing this or would like further help, there are a number of free debt organisations you can contact."}
{"question": "What benefits can individuals gain from exploring the Retirement Living Standards website provided by a finance company?", "answer": "So I would really sort of recommend spending a bit of time on this Retirement Living Standards website. Play around, have a look at the different costs and see what appeals to you. Its really helpful because it does break it down in some detail as to how much you might need to live on."}{"question": "What is the recommended annual income for a single person who desires a moderate standard of living in retirement, according to the researchers at a finance company?", "answer": "And its worth saying as well that there is the in-between version which is people who want to have what the researchers have called a moderate standard of living in retirement. And that means that you can go out a little bit at restaurants, have the odd takeaway here and there, you can spend a bit more on things like food and clothes and things like that. And you can run a car, but you wouldnt be able to replace it as often as if you had this comfortable lifestyle. And in that case the figure that you need is 20,800 a year for a single person."}
{"question": "How does living with a partner affect the annual income required compared to living alone, according to Royal London?", "answer": "Now Ive talked about how much youll need as a single person, as someone who lives on their own. If you do live with your partner, your husband or wife then obviously your costs will increase. But you wont need double the amount because generally its much cheaper for two people to live together than it is for two people to live in separate households. So in that example where Ive said for a moderate income youd need 20,800 a year if youre someone living on your own, youd need 30,600 a year if you were a couple."}
{"question": "What considerations did Royal London discuss regarding income generation and retirement planning?", "answer": "Now I know Ive thrown lots of figures around, but I think one thing I would just like to mention as well is that you dont have to generate that entire income on your own. Royal London talked earlier on about the State Pension and how much youll get from that. So depending on when you want to retire you may be able to have the State Pension kicking in from day one when you want to retire, or maybe a few years down the line if you want to retire below State Pension age."}
{"question": "When is the ideal time for individuals to begin saving for their pension, considering the context of the finance company mentioned earlier?", "answer": "Thats great Sarah. So this might be a bit of an obvious question, but when should people start saving into their pension?"}
{"question": "What is the importance of considering pensions and retirement income at an early stage of investment, specifically in relation to the compounding effect, for a finance company?", "answer": "Ah! Its a really good question. And you know I work for a pension company so you might expect me to say, pile this money into your pension. But really what I would say is do think about your pension and your retirement income when you can. The reason is that your pension money is invested. Its not just sitting in a bank account. And its the money that you pay into your pension in the early years that kind of does most of the hard work the really heavy lifting. And the reason is that the money you invest in the early years when it starts getting a return in later years when youre still making your contributions, the early contributions have generated their own return and then you start to get growth on those returns as well. Its called compounding and it can be quite powerful."}
{"question": "What is the significance of starting a pension earlier rather than later, particularly for individuals in their 20s, according to the paragraph?", "answer": "And I think its just one of those things that it can feel if youre young, in your 20s and so on, you can just think oh retirement is so far away. And especially Ive just talked about when people are going to get to State Pension age. But the reason it is really important to try and think about starting your pension earlier rather than later if you can, is because of this heavy lifting that the early contributions do."}
{"question": "What is the source of information for the moderate standard of living and comfortable standard of living according to the Retirement Living Standards website, which is associated with a finance company?", "answer": "So Ill just illustrate this with an example. I was talking earlier on about this sort of moderate standard of living, and comfortable standard of living from the Retirement Living Standards website."}
{"question": "What is the monthly contribution required for starting a pension with Royal London at the age of 22 if you are satisfied with a minimum annual income of 10,900?", "answer": "So if you were happy to live on the minimum income which is 10,900 a year and you were to start saving into your pension from the age of 22 then youd need to contribution 45 a month. Now if you left it until you were 40 that figure would rise to 90 a month."}
{"question": "What is the monthly saving amount required by Royal London if one wants to generate an income of 20,800 a year after retirement?", "answer": "Now if you prefer to live on that sort of moderate standard of living in retirement that middle one, so in which case youd need to generate the income of 20,800 a year. Well in that case if you started saving when you were 22, the figure you would have to save would be 340 a month. But again it would almost double, it would be about 660 if you waited until you were 40."}
{"question": "What additional contributions are included in the workplace pension offered by Royal London besides the ones made by the individual?", "answer": "Now again it is worth saying around those figures that Ive quoted if youre in a workplace pension whether its 45 a month you pay or whatever it is, 340, thats not just down to your own contributions. That figure includes any money that youre getting from your employer by way of contributions and the government top up that youll get through tax relief."}
{"question": "What assumptions did Royal London make regarding inflation, entitlement to the full state pension, returns, and charges while comparing the difference between starting to save for retirement at age 22 and starting at age 40?", "answer": "Royal London have made some assumptions around these figures. So weve made some assumptions about inflation, Royal London have assumed that youre entitled to the full state pension at age 66. Weve made some assumptions about the returns and about charges. So these figures arent set in stone, but they are just to give you a guide of the difference between starting to save for your retirement at age 22 and then not being able to or leaving it until youre age 40."}
{"question": "What is the process for joining a workplace pension scheme at Royal London for employed individuals earning more than 10,000 a year?", "answer": "Again it is worth saying again anyone whos employed, or a worker, as opposed to being self-employed, as long as theyre aged 22 or over and earning more that 10,000 a year they will be automatically put into their employers workplace pension scheme. Now you can leave it if you want to, but in order to join it you dont have to fill in reams of paperwork that work is already done for you."}
{"question": "How much is the ideal contribution amount for individuals saving into a pension at Royal London or any other finance company?", "answer": "Okay so, youve made the decision to start saving into a pension or not to leave the scheme if you have been put into your workplace pension. But how much should you be paying in?"}
{"question": "What is the minimum amount that goes into a workplace pension for individuals enrolled in their employers' pension scheme at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah now thats a really good question. Its one of those questions that Royal London get asked a lot. So again its really important to think about how much you want to retire on and thats why thinking about the retirement lifestyle you want is so incredibly important. So the answer really will sort of depend, different people have different answers. But for example at the moment if you are enrolled into your employers workplace pension scheme, you will be saving 8% - thats the kind of minimum amount that will go into a workplace pension. And thats roughly 8% of your salary and that will be made up of your own contributions, and your employers contributions and this government tax top up. So the employer will pay in 3%, you will pay in 4% and then youll get an extra 1% which is this tax top up from the government."}
{"question": "What should individuals consider when assessing if their pension scheme contributions with Royal London are sufficient for their desired retirement lifestyle?", "answer": "And so you think great well thats money in going in, and Im in my pension scheme, happy days. But I think it is really important to think about whether thats going to be enough for the retirement that youd like. And especially as weve heard from people who have been voting that lots of us want to have a nice lifestyle in retirement and you completely understand why. So I think its really important to think about there may be a gap between what youre paying and what you want, what you actually need, in terms of generating that income at retirement."}
{"question": "What are some useful websites, including one on the Royal London website, that can help calculate your pension income and determine if there is a gap between your desired income and what you have currently?", "answer": "So there are some useful websites that can help you work this out, there are some pension calculators. Weve got one on Royal London on website. Theres one also on a website called MoneyHelper which is an impartial government-backed website. And what you can do with these pension calculators is you can put in information about how much youre paying into your pension at the moment, how much your employer is paying in, and tax relief, and then any other pensions that you may have built up over the years you can put in those details. And then itll start to tell you what kind of income you might generate in retirement. Once you see that figure I think you can really start to work out is there a gap between what I want and what Ive got?"}
{"question": "Why is a financial adviser essential for understanding figures, picturing retirement, and managing pension contributions, especially when overwhelmed by the complexity of financial planning?", "answer": "I think as well, its really important to say that you know, Im talking about lots of figures and picturing your retirement and working out how much is going into your pension, and how much you might get. And people might be thinking, I need to wrap a cold towel around my head and have a lie down! And thats where I think, why a financial adviser can be so helpful."}
{"question": "What is the importance of financial advice according to a finance company that champions it, based on their research at Royal London?", "answer": "At Royal London, were champions of financial advice. Royal London think its really important for people to get financial advice. And one of the reasons is that weve done some research over the years that shows that financial advice doesnt just make people better off financially it also helps them emotionally. So people who take regular financial advice are less likely to be anxious about their finances. Theyre more likely to feel comfortable about their own financial future."}
{"question": "What role can a financial adviser play in helping individuals plan for their retirement lifestyle and determine the necessary income, including considering the State Pension, by working backwards from their desired lifestyle in retirement?", "answer": "And what a financial adviser can do in this situation is they can really look at, help you to unpick that retirement lifestyle that youd like and start to put some figures against it and then work backwards and say; okay you want this lifestyle in retirement, this is the kind of income youd need to have including any State Pension for example, this is the income youd need to have when you retire, lets work backwards - this is the age you are now and therefore this is the amount that you should be setting aside every month."}
{"question": "\"What are some resources that can serve as a useful starting point for conducting research on financial matters, especially for individuals who do not have a financial adviser, such as the MoneyHelper website endorsed by a reputable and government-backed source?\"", "answer": "So as I said I think having financial advice around something like this is really, really useful. But Royal London know not everybody has a financial adviser, many people dont so those calculators, and the MoneyHelper website that I mentioned, they can be a really useful as a really good starting point for you to do your own research. And even if you do have a financial adviser, I know lots of people like to do their own research before they talk to their adviser, so they feel theyve got their head in the right space. So thats why those websites can be a really good starting point. So the address of the MoneyHelper website, as I said its impartial and government-backed, is"}
{"question": "What are some top tips that Royal London provides to individuals who have retired and are unsure about what to do with their finances?", "answer": "Thats great Sarah, and I know that weve spoken in the past and said that actually Royal London speak to a lot of people about their finances and pension and retirement, and people whove retired, and actually Royal London very rarely Royal London meet people who say Ive got so much money, Im retired now, I dont know what to do with it so these are top tips. Thanks Sarah."}
{"question": "What should be the percentage of salary put into the pension if someone starts saving into their pension at the age of 22 according to Royal London's rules?", "answer": "Yeah thats another really good question. I mean there are a few rules of thumb that Ive seen over the years that are flying around but one that I think can be quite useful - take the age that you start saving into your pension and then thats the basis of how much you should be putting into your pension every month as a percentage of your salary. So if Royal London take somebody who can be automatically enrolled into their workplace pension, theyll be 22 when that happens, so if you start saving into your pension when youre 22, if you halve that age you get 11 then 11% is the amount of your salary or income that should be going into your pension every month. If you wait until youre 30, if you cant or you dont think about saving into your pension til youre 30, halve that thats then 15%. If its 40 before you think about or are able to save for your pension I think thats when it starts getting a bit eek!. Its actually 20% of your salary then that needs to go into your pension."}
{"question": "What benefits does Royal London provide to its employees through their workplace pension scheme, including contributions from both the employer and the government?", "answer": "But again while Im talking about these figures as you know 11%, 15% or 20% thats the total amount. So again if youre employed or youre a worker, youll be in your employers workplace pension scheme. So that includes not only your pension contributions but your employers and that top up from the government by way of tax relief."}
{"question": "What advice would you give to individuals who haven't begun saving in their early twenties, particularly those unable to save more due to the current economic situation, in order to achieve their goals, given the context from Sarah's perspective mentioned previously?", "answer": "So thats definitely a great starting point to think about. Now, Sarah what would you say to people who didn't start saving in their early twenties though, especially if they can't afford to be saving more because of the current climate? I mean, is there anything else they could be doing to reach their goals?"}
{"question": "What are some common priorities and competing expenses that individuals often have instead of investing in Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah again I think its a really good question and for a lot of people there are always other priorities, there are always things that you think, oh actually I could be spending my money on this, or sometimes, I should be spending my money on this."}
{"question": "What advice does Royal London offer to individuals who realize they don't have enough savings for their desired retirement?", "answer": "And you know, Royal London have got a cost-of-living crisis. And Im aware from talking to people of some of the really tough choices that people are having to make. So the first thing Id say is that if you get to the stage in your life when suddenly retirement is feeling rather more real and you realise that you dont have the kind of pension pot saved up thats going to give you the kind of retirement you would really like, dont panic because all is not lost."}
{"question": "What opportunities are available to individuals in the finance industry, particularly at a company like Royal London, to further enhance their skills and abilities?", "answer": "Theres a couple of things that you may be able to do. Now some people may be able to do more of them than others, but Ill just run through them anyway."}
{"question": "Can Royal London provide guidance on when is the appropriate time to consider increasing pension contributions?", "answer": "First of all, think about whether youre in a position to put more money into your pension, thats obvious in a way. But you may be able to put a lump sum in or maybe even just to edge up your monthly contributions. Even paying in an extra 1% of your salary every year could make a difference to the amount that you have at retirement. And if its not something you can do at the moment, maybe you are worrying about the cost of living, is it something you can do in 6 months? Is it something you can set a reminder to do in a year or at some point in the future? Even if its something you cant do now, dont just kind of ignore it, do try and come back to it if you can."}
{"question": "What are some other savings or investments options that can generate retirement income, excluding pensions, that Royal London often discusses?", "answer": "The other thing to look at is you may have other savings or investments. So I think Royal London often talk about retirement and pensions interchangeably and although pensions are a really tax-efficient way to save for your retirement and if youre in a workplace pension you have that advantage of getting the contributions from your employer as well. But people may have savings or ISAs or other things and it doesnt have to be that your retirement income is only generated by your pension."}
{"question": "Can you reconsider your retirement plans and potentially continue working full-time or part-time, as seen in the poll conducted by Royal London regarding the desired retirement ages?", "answer": "The other thing is can you retire later than youd planned? Again Royal London heard from the poll, Royal London saw in the poll, the ages at which people wanted to retire but can you revisit that and either carry on working full time or maybe even part time? Now in days gone by you had to retire at the age of 65, but the default retirement age was abolished over a decade ago so now you do have much more choice about when you retire so thats another thing to look at."}
{"question": "Can you consider using equity release from Royal London to release some cash without selling your home or downsizing?", "answer": "And I think lastly just think about where youre going to live. So if you own your home, do you want to live in the same kind of property? Could you maybe free up some cash by selling and downsizing, buying something thats a bit cheaper and having a lump sum of money? Maybe you think well actually I dont want to move, I love where I live, Im really happy here. Well in which case perhaps you could consider releasing some equity through equity release which is where you basically you take out a mortgage that you dont pay back until you either die or move into long term care."}
{"question": "What are some important steps to consider when making significant financial decisions, especially if retirement feels imminent, according to the advice provided by this finance company?", "answer": "Now some of these decisions are going to be really big decisions, so if youre thinking about selling up a property, talk about it with your family. If youre thinking about equity release talk about it with your family, but its also really important to take legal and financial advice. I think the point is that even if you think actually, this is not where I wanted to be, Im at whatever age I am and retirement suddenly feels quite real, there may be steps that you can take."}
{"question": "What is the figure of the State Pension for someone retiring at the moment, as discussed by a finance company earlier known for their insights on retirement planning and finance?", "answer": "Yeah I think this is such a good question and Royal London talked earlier on about how much the State Pension was, is. So for somebody retiring at the moment its this figure of 9,339 a year. Now thats assuming that youre entitled to the full State Pension. So in that case youve either paid National Insurance for 35 years or youve been credited with National Insurance for part of that time, perhaps because you were out of work, claiming benefits, you were ill or you were not working, you were looking after your children and claiming child benefit."}
{"question": "How does the amount of 179 a week from Royal London contribute towards covering necessary expenses such as bills, food, and recreational activities?", "answer": "Now that figure works out at around 179 a week. And again, if you want to break it down into a daily figure that comes in at just under 26 a day. And again if you think about that, and Ive talked about this before, about this and State Pension figures to other people, that sort of 26 a day, and I think theres the assumption thats your spending money. Thats your money for your coffee and your treats. But its not. That 179 a week, 26 a day, thats the money that you have to live on. Thats what you have to pay your bills, your food. If you want to go out its got to pay for everything."}
{"question": "How can you ensure a comfortable retirement without solely relying on the State Pension, considering factors like timing and potential age restrictions, according to an insurance and investment company's perspective?", "answer": "And again some people might think, well actually I am quite happy with a fairly modest standard of living in retirement. But if thats not you, if you dont want to just retire on the State Pension then you really do have to think about paying into a pension, how else are you going to fund your retirement? And as I said much earlier on its not just about how much you get its also about when you get it. Are you happy to wait until youre 66 or possibly even later to get that income in retirement?"}
{"question": "Would you be content relying solely on the State Pension for your retirement, excluding any other specific financial institution mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "Okay so lets just do one last poll to have a think about that and to ask, would you be happy living on the State Pension alone, just State Pension, when you retire? So if you fill in the poll question and well see what most people think."}
{"question": "Would most people believe that the amount of money they have for retirement, aside from the State Pension, would be sufficient, based on the responses from earlier?", "answer": "I think the responses from earlier showed that people wanted to retire before State Pension age so theres a bit of a gap there, but would most people think that that amount of money is going to be enough in retirement? I think its fairly conclusive Sarah so far. The numbers are still going up, but the percentage isnt really changing. So it looks like 98% of people are saying actually they would need more money than State Pension in their retirement."}
{"question": "What recommendations does Sarah have for individuals looking to secure their pension savings and attain the flexibility to retire on their terms, in order to enjoy their desired lifestyle in retirement?", "answer": "So Sarah what would you suggest to people that, what can they do to make sure theyve got those pension savings, so they have that choice of when to retire and how to enjoy their retirement and that lifestyle that they want in retirement?"}
{"question": "What is the eligibility criteria for joining a workplace pension scheme at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah so first of all I mentioned earlier on about workplace pensions, and you know these days most people will be in a workplace pension, so as I mentioned if youre age 22 or over and if you earn at least 10,000 a year. Now it is important to say that if you have more that one job then that 10,000 threshold applies to each of your jobs."}
{"question": "What is the understanding of Royal London regarding the prioritization of pensions, especially for younger individuals with other financial obligations?", "answer": "So if you are in a workplace pension then you know its really important to stay in that because its a really good foundation for your retirement. And as I mentioned the benefit of a workplace pension is not only is your money going in, but you get that money from your work, from your employer, as well. I do understand, Ive been talking about pension and savings, save for your retirement, prioritise your pensions, prioritise your retirement and I really understand that for a lot of people, especially for younger people you might be thinking Ive got other things to pay, I really have, I cant prioritise my pension, and I do get that. I think Royal London all get that, especially at the moment."}
{"question": "What was the percentage of people in a poll conducted by Royal London who believed that the State Pension alone would not be sufficient for their retirement?", "answer": "But I think it really comes back to this, well two fundamental points. One of them is if you dont save for your retirement what will you live on? And Royal London just saw from that poll 98% of people said they didnt think the State Pension was enough for them. So if you dont have any other pension then you will be living on just the State Pension."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of starting a pension early, especially in terms of the monthly contribution amount, considering the compounding effect and the significant impact of early contributions on one's future financial situation?", "answer": "And I think as well, its thinking about okay well if I dont, if Im not happy just to live on the State Pension and I really need to think about having a pension. I also mentioned earlier on that its those earlier contributions that will do the real heavy lifting. Of course people have to make their own decision about what their priorities are but the earlier you start the easier it is in terms of the monthly amount that you need to pay in because of this compounding effect, because of the heavy work that those early contributions will do for you."}
{"question": "Can individuals increase their contributions to their workplace pension in Royal London?", "answer": "So Sarah, lets think about someone who has a set amount going into their workplace pension, now can they pay more into their pension if they wanted to?"}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of contributing more than the minimum 8% of one's salary to their workplace pension at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah absolutely. So again I was talking earlier on about this minimum amount of approximately 8% of your salary that will be going into your workplace pension. But you can pay more in, and even a relatively small amount, you know an extra percent or 2%, can make a difference potentially to the mount of money that youre going to get when you retire."}
{"question": "What is the approach of Royal London regarding employer matching and what is the maximum contribution they match?", "answer": "But you may also get some help from your employer if you do that. Quite a few employers will do whats called marching contributions. So in that case if you want to pay in some extra, so say at the moment youre paying in 4% of your salary plus 1% of government top up of tax relief thats going in. Well if you could afford to pay 5, 6, 7% your employer will match that pound for pound. Now different employers have a different approach. Some of them may match up to a limit of 7% some 8, 9, 10. A few of them even higher. So it is really worth asking your employer do you do employer matching? If so, whats the limit? Whats the maximum I can put in with you matching that pound for pound? Now again as I said not all employers will do this but there are a couple of other options to think about."}
{"question": "How can employees at financial companies like Royal London benefit from bonus sacrifice or bonus exchange?", "answer": "So if youre in the kind of job where you get a bonus then you can do something called a bonus sacrifice or a bonus exchange. And the way that works is that instead of getting your bonus paid into your bank account you give up some or all of it. Now that could be a percentage or you could decide to give up a certain amount, up to a certain limit. And in that case the bit that you exchange doesnt end up in your bank account, instead it is paid directly into your pension by your employer. Now the advantage of that, apart from having more money going into your pension, is that you save tax and National Insurance on the bit that you give up and your employer saves National Insurance as well."}
{"question": "What is the process of salary sacrifice or salary exchange, and how does it benefit both the employee and the employer at Royal London?", "answer": "Now if you dont get a bonus, theres something called salary sacrifice, or salary exchange, that you can also do in a similar way. So here, you and your employer agree that you will exchange a percentage of your salary and again that money will go directly into your pension. So again itll save you some tax and National Insurance and save your employer some National Insurance as well."}
{"question": "What are some factors to consider when thinking about pension options, such as employer matching, bonus exchange, and salary exchange, at Royal London or any other finance company?", "answer": "Now these are just suggestions, Im not giving advice, these are just things to think about. So salary exchange in particular it may not be right for everybody. So for example it will affect any salary related benefits that you might get. So Royal London obviously hope that people dont have to be furloughed in the future, but your furlough pay is based on your salary so if youve exchanged some of it, it will affect that. And again there are certain benefits that are maybe related to the amount of salary you get. So its just something to think about, its not necessarily right for everybody. But I would just say one thing which is, years and years ago I used to work for the BBC, a very very long time ago. Before you were automatically put into your workplace pension. The days when you had to sign up and go through the paperwork and join. And I did join the pension scheme quite early on. And I was paying, you know whatever it was, into my pension. And to be honest I didnt really give it any thought as to whether it was enough or not. I was just kind of, Im in the pension job done. And then I started working on a personal finance programme on radio after Id been at the BBC for a few months. And I guess if you can imagine, pensions were a hot topic. Previously I hadnt really been somebody who found finance, pensions, that fascinating, it wasnt something I spent my childhood and teenage years talking about. But I did find it interesting when I started working on this programme. And a couple of people were talking about their pensions and how much they were paying in. And they mentioned that they were paying in more than the standard amount, and to be honest it wasnt really something I was aware you could do, and it certainly hadnt really crossed my mind for me. But it was something I thought, I really ought to get my act together, because the way they were talking about it, it seemed to make a lot of sense. And it was something I did. And in some ways you can say, it is something Im very glad I did. But it wasnt almost like it was a conscious decision where I got out my spreadsheet and started to look at how much Id need. It was really based on this conversation I had with a couple of my colleagues when they were like, well actually this is why it could be a good thing to do. So I think sometimes its thinking about your pension, there are unusual things that can trigger that thought process and conversation. But its definitely worth exploring employer matching, if you get a bonus whether bonus exchange is right for you, and as I mentioned salary exchange or sacrifice as well."}
{"question": "What are the three key takeaways from today's discussion at Royal London?", "answer": "Thats great Sarah. Now just to finish off, what are the three key things that everyone should think about and take away from today?"}
{"question": "When considering financial independence, how can changing our mindset and adopting the concept of an individual's \"financial independence day\" help us better plan for retirement?", "answer": "I think the first thing is this mindset shift, and I mentioned this idea of being or having your own financial independence day, and its something that really made a difference to me as to how I thought about my own retirement. So dont think about retirement as being something that in inverted commas old people do, and you sort of shuffle off to the end of your working life. Start to think about, when do I want to not have to work to pay my bills? I can work if I want to, but when do I want to have my own financial independence day?"}
{"question": "What are the benefits of thinking about saving in a cash savings account or a pension instead of considering it as giving up money today, according to Royal London?", "answer": "And again if youre looking at money thats coming into your salary and money thats going out to your pension it can feel like youre depriving yourself. Youre thinking, thats money I could spend today. But again this is something that Ive found really helpful when Im thinking about either saving in cash savings account or my pension is instead of thinking about the money that I therefore wouldnt have to spend today as being given up, its about buying myself options and choice further down the road. So whether thats about having the ability to go on holiday without putting it on a credit card. Or being able to retire without having to live on the State Pension which Royal London poll told us that 98% of people dont want to do."}
{"question": "What resources does Royal London provide for determining retirement lifestyle preferences and planning for it financially?", "answer": "The second thing is to really think about the retirement lifestyle youd like. So not thinking about it in vague terms, just really start to put some numbers against it. So I mentioned that Retirement Living Standards website. I talked about how financial advisers can help. And theres calculators that weve got, and also theres one on the MoneyHelper website."}
{"question": "What are some strategies to increase the savings in a workplace pension offered by a finance company like Royal London?", "answer": "And then lastly, if youre in a workplace pension, dont opt out of it if you can afford not to. Think about how much is going in and maybe look at ways that you could increase the amount that youre saving, if its something that you can afford to do."}
{"question": "What kind of questions has Royal London been receiving?", "answer": "Okay, brilliant, so thanks for those three top tips and I totally agree that mindset shift is absolutely crucial. Now weve had questions coming in while weve been talking so lets move on to them and see the type of things that Royal London have been getting."}
{"question": "What is the explanation of tax relief, particularly in the context of the finance company Royal London?", "answer": "So, there are quite a few questions. Ah now! This is one that often Ive come across and I know youve come across. So Amy says - I dont really understand how tax relief works, can you explain it some more please?"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of tax relief in terms of the money going into your pension at Royal London?", "answer": "Yeah, Amy its a really good question, Ill give it my best shot! I think one of the problems with tax relief is I dont think the name really explains what it does. But the way to think about it is as a government top up in terms of the money thats going into your pension."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of tax relief when paying into a pension with Royal London?", "answer": "So I think the easiest way to explain it is with an example. So assuming that you want to say pay 100 a month into your pension. If youre a basic rate taxpayer you will have already been paying tax on income that you receive. But when you put that money into your pension the government effectively kind of gives you some tax back as a top up. So back to the 100 a month example, if youre a basic rate taxpayer, and you want to pay in 100 a month, it will actually only cost you 80 a month because the government will pay in the other 20 in tax relief. Now if youre a higher or an additional rate taxpayer then you can reclaim higher rates of tax, you can normally do that through your self-assessment form if you fill it in. Its one of those things that you know, pensions does sometimes have some not very user-friendly jargon and I think tax relief is one of those things that doesnt really explain what it does. But once you understand it, I think its really useful to think, every time Im paying into my pension the government is paying as well. And its not every day that you get money from the government, so I think its definitely a good one to understand and think about!"}
{"question": "What should individuals in a salary exchange scheme consider if they are higher rate or additional rate taxpayers, specifically related to a finance company?", "answer": "Definitely and to just add to that as well that depending on the type of scheme youre in you might have to, if youre a higher rate or additional rate taxpayer, you might have to claim it back. But if youre in a salary exchange scheme then that will automatically happen so its worth checking that if you are a higher rate or additional rate taxpayer."}
{"question": "What is a common query addressed to Royal London regarding combining pensions from various previous employers?", "answer": "Now the top question just now is I have a number of pensions from different previous employers, should I combine them? And again this is a question Royal London get asked quite a lot isnt it Sarah?"}
{"question": "What makes Royal London stand out in the finance industry?", "answer": "Yeah and I mean its one of those questions, its a really really good question and youre going to hate me for saying this but there isnt really a straightforward answer!"}
{"question": "What are the pros and cons of seeking financial advice, particularly from a trusted company like Royal London?", "answer": "There are pros and cons and its the kind of thing that its a really good idea to get financial advice on, but ill just give you a couple of things to think about."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of consolidating pensions, especially for individuals who struggle with managing multiple pots, and how does the upcoming Pensions Dashboard introduced by Royal London simplify the process of viewing all pensions in one place?", "answer": "So reasons why it might be a good idea to combine your pensions. If youre somebody who finds it hard to keep track of lots of different pots then it can be easier to see them all in one go. Having said that there is something coming down the track called the Pensions Dashboard which means that youll be able to see on one sort of, as it sounds, dashboard, all your pensions at the same time. So thats maybe just worth being aware of."}
{"question": "What factors should be considered when transferring your money to another financial company, such as Royal London, to ensure you are not giving up any valuable existing benefits?", "answer": "Reasons why it might not be a good idea. In terms of where youre moving your money to its always worth just looking at what the charges are, whether youre giving up any existing benefits from your pensions. So some very old-style pensions have some specific benefits which can be quite valuable and if you were to give those up by transferring elsewhere then you could be worse off."}
{"question": "What are the two main categories of pensions, and how does Royal London fit into these categories?", "answer": "And it is worth saying, were talking about combining pension posts like pensions are all the same but there are two main categories of pension. One is whats called a defined contribution pension which is what most people will be saving into these days and its where you pay in money, your employer does, you get this government tax top up and then you get a pot of money at the end that you can take money Royal London of or convert into a guaranteed income. But a while ago a lot of people were in what was called a defined benefit or final salary scheme and there the amount the you get at retirement is linked directly to your salary rather than the pot that you have that youve been growing over the years."}
{"question": "What does combining a final salary pension with another one generally indicate, according to Royal London?", "answer": "So in this case, generally, thinking of combining a final salary pension with another one its generally a bad idea. Again, there can be some exceptions, but the starting point is often this is not a good idea and if its something youre thinking about, unless youve got a very small pensions, youll normally have to take financial advice as well."}
{"question": "What sources provide information about this topic, besides the Royal London website?", "answer": "Again there is information about this on Royal London website, theres also information about it on the MoneyHelper website. But if you are thinking of doing it its a really good idea to take some financial advice first."}
{"question": "Can Royal London provide a recommendation on whether it is advisable to prioritize paying off a mortgage or increasing pension contributions?", "answer": "Okay so, next question is should I pay off my mortgage before increasing pension contributions? Now thats another interesting one isnt and its probably another one that theres not quite a right or wrong answer, but Sarah what would you recommend well Royal London cant really recommend what would you say to that question?"}
{"question": "What are some suggestions and things to think about when seeking financial advice from a company like Royal London?", "answer": "Its a really good question again and I dont want to frustrate people by saying theres no easy answer, but first of all Im not a financial adviser so I cant give you advice, I can just give you some suggestions and things to think about."}
{"question": "What are the factors that determine whether one should consider reducing their mortgage with a company like Royal London, especially considering the uncertainty surrounding interest rates?", "answer": "So first of all I think it depends on how much your mortgage might be and whether its the kind of thing that might stress you at the moment. So Royal London dont know whats going to happen to interest rates. Some people are on a variable rate, so for example if youre on a variable interest rate and youre worried about interest rates rising, you might think actually Id rather get my mortgage down a bit if I possibly can."}
{"question": "How does paying extra into your pension at Royal London potentially make a big difference, especially in the early years?", "answer": "Sometimes because of the way fixed rates are priced, you can get a much better fixed rate if you have a little bit more equity so you might think Ill pay it down a little bit and I can qualify for a better fixed rate. Again that might be something to think about. On the other hand, I was talking about why how a bit extra into your pension potentially could make a big difference especially in the early years. So my thoughts would be it doesnt necessarily have to be either/or. I think it depends on the size of your mortgage, what your plans might be, how much the mortgage is compared to the value of your property, whether youre on a variable rate deal, how much headroom youve got in your budget if you are on a variable rate deal. Would you not be able to sleep at night if mortgage rates go up? But also think about the tax efficiency of pensions and the fact that if you are paying extra into your pension and youre working, youre employed, you could potentially get some more money from your employer if they do this matching."}
{"question": "What financial decision did the speaker make regarding mortgage and pension contributions, considering their future retirement and the company they mentioned?", "answer": "The last thing Ill just say and again this is not advice, this is just what I did. I did a bit of both, I did pay a bit extra off on my mortgage when I could, but I also like I mentioned earlier on, increased my pension contribution. Because although it was important to think about my mortgage its actually my pension Im going to be living on when I retire, not my house."}
{"question": "What does Royal London offer in terms of dealing with death and passing on pensions to children?", "answer": "Yeah, okay then, theres a couple of questions that are sort of dealing with death. So what happens to my pension when I die? And theres also another question about passing on pensions to children. Sarah, shall I pick up this question because this is certainly a topic which comes up quite a lot?"}
{"question": "What are the differences in death benefits between the two types of pensions offered by Royal London, such as the one based on retirement savings and employer contributions, and the final salary or defined benefit pension?", "answer": "Now again Sarah mentioned this issue of the difference between the two types of pensions, so the pension when you save up and you have a fund on retirement that your employers contributed to, or final salary or defined benefit type pensions. Now the death benefits are quite different."}
{"question": "What happens to the death benefits in a personal pension or workplace scheme offered by a finance company like Royal London if the policyholder dies?", "answer": "So what I would say is if youre thinking, if you have a personal pension or a workplace scheme where you are contributing and youre expecting this fund on retirement and you kind of choose what to do, then normally what happens is the death benefits if you died would go to the people that you would want them to go to."}
{"question": "What is one crucial task individuals often overlook when it comes to financial planning and specifically regarding the distribution of death benefits, especially when it involves a company like Royal London?", "answer": "Now whats really important, and often people forget about this, is that there are forms to be filled in, and on that form you put down who you would like to receive the death benefits. Now obviously the older you are, the bigger the fund can be, and actually if you die when youre under 75, your beneficiaries will get that money without paying any income tax. So its really important to fill in that form, to say who you would like to receive the benefits."}
{"question": "What is the importance of filling in the necessary forms for workplace schemes and how does it relate to Royal London's operations?", "answer": "Now again its a bit of a tricky question because different schemes operate in different ways and you can ask exactly how it works, but that fund of money isnt going to disappear when its sitting in your pension. In most scenarios it is going to end up with the people that you would want to receive it. But make sure you fill in these forms. So if you havent filled one in and youre in a workplace scheme then ask your employer for one because its really important."}
{"question": "How can I ensure that my family, including my husband and three children, will receive the death benefits from a finance company?", "answer": "I know that certainly I would want to know that my family were going to receive the benefits so Ive asked that my husband and my three children would receive the death benefits when I die because its important to me that they would all have a share."}
{"question": "What did the finance company with a reference to a sore throat say about their response to a particular question?", "answer": "No I think you answered that very well and because Ive got a bit of a sore throat I was using the opportunity to have a glass of water so thank you for picking up that question!"}
{"question": "What kind of questions are being submitted and appreciated by Royal London?", "answer": "Again, were getting some great questions so thanks so much to people who are submitting questions, and also who are voting the questions up, so Ive seen some that were getting in, the popular questions. Its really appreciated."}
{"question": "What should be considered when deciding between increasing contributions to a workplace pension or opting for an individual plan, taking into account potential benefits from the employer at Royal London?", "answer": "As I said really good question. So I think in terms of whether to pay more into your workplace pension or to have your own, I mentioned the extra benefits that you may get from your employer. So if they do this matching of contributions. So again this is not advice, but my starting point would be to start with my employer, find out whether they will match contributions up to a certain limit if I pay extra. So every pound you pay youll get a pound from your employer."}
{"question": "What is one tax efficient way of increasing contributions to a pension plan, which Royal London suggests considering?", "answer": "Also think about whether you can use this bonus exchange or salary exchange because thats quite a tax efficient way of paying extra money into your pension. There may be reasons why you might want to run your own pension. Its normally to do with if your workplace, if you want to invest in a certain kind of fund that your workplace pension doesnt offer. But I would just say one word of, well not quite caution, which is maybe one thing to explore before that. The vast majority of people who are in a workplace pension are in whats called a default fund. So basically thats the fund that youll be put in to if you dont actively decide to put your money into a different fund."}
{"question": "What should I consider if I want to handle my own pension and invest my money in a certain way with a workplace pension provider like Royal London?", "answer": "Default funds can vary from one workplace pension provider to another, but I think the bigger point is that if you are in that default fund, or even if youre not, your workplace pension may offer funds that you werent aware of or that you havent though about switching your money to. So if its about thinking, actually I want to handle my own pension because I want to invest my money in a certain way, then maybe look at your workplace pension first just to be sure that they dont offer that option. Because what you may be able to do is split your money and have some of it going into one fund and some going elsewhere, so thats definitely something I would think about"}
{"question": "Should stay-at-home parents consider setting up a private pension like Royal London, even if they are not currently employed?", "answer": "Okay now Im just flicking through the questions, weve only really got a minute left. Theres an interesting one thats come up with someone whos a stay-at-home mum, Sarah. And I think its important to think about this as well because there are quite a lot of people who dont.

So I really look at kind of areas of consumer finance. So it's not just things like pensions and protection products, but Royal London know that people's lives aren't associated with a particular product. They have mortgages, Royal London have debt, Royal London bank accounts. So looking at the broader areas as well, and particularly, I guess, given a nod to what's happened in the last 18 months, looking at things like life shocks and life events, how those can really derail your financial plans and the impact that those can have."}

Well, I love a bit of that Sarah. Thank you again for being on this mornings show. Big wide question to start with. What are the common questions people ask about pension? When Royal London meet them, they often say, should I consolidate Royal London pension pots and how much should I pay in? So what's the answer? How much should people be paying into their pension funds?"}
{"question": "What factors contribute to the complexity of determining a suitable monthly retirement contribution, considering an individual's desired retirement lifestyle and activities?", "answer": "Sarah: It is a really great question. As you say, it's one that people ask all the time. And I think it will be a very short webinar, but it would be great if I could say 200 quid a month or even better, maybe 50 a month. But it's not that simple, as you know. And I think the key really is to why it isn't that simple is it depends so much on the kind of retirement that you want, the kind of things that you want to do in your retirement."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of starting a pension with Royal London, especially for those who are far from retirement?", "answer": "And crucially, when you want to start doing them. And that's something that I think it's actually really hard to think about. And it is hard to think about the further away from retirement that you are. So I mean, you said there's like, 1400 people on this webinar which is fantastic. Many of them will probably be in workplace pensions. And in that case, there will be an amount that's going into your pension every month because your employer is paying and in youre paying in and the government pays in a bit as well."}
{"question": "What is the potential outcome if the minimum contribution of around 8% of your salary is not sufficient for the desired retirement, as indicated by Royal London?", "answer": "And that's going be a minimum of around 8% of your salary. But as I think Royal London'll be showing over the next 20 minutes or so, that may not be enough to give you the kind of retirement that you want. And it is one of those things that I think you mentioned earlier on that you very rarely meet people who say, oh, I wish I wasn't paying so much into my pension. And likewise, I meet quite few people who've already retired, and I very rarely meet people who say, I've got so much money. I'm retired now, I've got so much money. I have not got a clue what to do with it."}
{"question": "What are the common regrets expressed by individuals regarding savings and retirement planning, as observed during your experience as a financial journalist before joining a particular financial company?", "answer": "Sadly, I do meet people. And I certainly did as a financial journalist for 20-something years before I joined Royal London. I certainly then met a lot of people who said, I really wish Id started saving earlier. So I think it's actually about trying to picture that life that you want when you stop work, trying to work out what that's going to cost. And, crucially, when you want to stop working."}
{"question": "What is the significance of financial advisers at Royal London in terms of retirement planning and translating individuals' lifestyle preferences into pension contributions?", "answer": "And you might be thinking, oh, that just sounds like a huge amount of work. Where do I start working that out? And there are two options. And at Royal London, Royal London're big fans of financial advice. Royal London think it's the gold standard. And this is really where a financial adviser can come into their own, because this is - theyre really skilled at helping you plan your retirement. And they can translate those ideas you have about how you want to spend your time, where you want to live, what you want to spend your money on, into what it means, how much you pay into your pension."}
{"question": "What are some resources available, besides the Royal London website, for individuals who don't have a financial adviser and want to calculate their pension contributions?", "answer": "But if you don't have a financial adviser or even if you just want to do a bit of research before you go and see your financial adviser, there are loads of pension calculators that will help you input money in, you can put in what you're paying now, maybe old pensions that you have, and then work out what that will give you. So Royal London've got one on Royal London site, you'd expect me to say that, but there's also one on the MoneyHelper website, which is the government-backed impartial money information and guidance website. So those are really good starting places to think about how much to pay in."}
{"question": "What should I do if I want to visit the official website of the finance company mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "James: That was perfect. What you just did there, Sarah, I've just got to applaud that because I should have said earlier that if you go onto Royal London website, which is hang on a minute. I written it up there."}
{"question": "How is Royal London involved in supporting individuals during Pensionswarenessday.com?", "answer": "Pensionswarenessday.com. I quite often add an extra s in there, which doesn't help. So pensionswarenessday.com, people can sign up for a one-to-one chat, which isn't advice. It's guidance, and they are being delivered and supported in this journey this week by MoneyHelper team So thank you for that link. Is it's almost like Royal London rehearsed it."}
{"question": "What concerns arise regarding the 8% payment made by people, and how does it relate to Royal London's pension policies?", "answer": "So the 8% that people are paying in. I've got two concerns with this one is that it's not enough, but another also is that people aren't paying in 8% of their total earnings, sometimes people are paying 8% of their banded earnings. And I think a lot of people in the UK don't know that their entire salary isn't used for pension purposes. That aside, though, is 8% enough? And is there a rule of thumb you can use to get people closer to the right number?"}
{"question": "What are the considerations for determining the suitable retirement plan at Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah: Yeah. Again, it's a really good question. And as you say, this 8%, that's the minimum amount that should be going in. But as you rightly say, it's not a whole of people's earnings. I think for most people, it's probably not going to be enough is probably the simple answer. But it does depend on the kind of retirement you want. So I will go back to this idea of thinking about retirement, and I'll come back to kind of rule of thumb figure if that's okay. I said I think it's quite hard to pick the kind of retirement that you want."}
{"question": "What factors should I consider when determining how I want to spend my time and how much it would cost me, particularly in relation to a well-known finance company?", "answer": "I find it quite a hard thing. Well, actually, how do I want to spend my time? And crucially, what does that, what's that going to cost me?"}
{"question": "What is the name of the pensions organization that has developed the retirementlivingstandards.org.uk website, which is considered helpful by Royal London?", "answer": "So there's a really useful, theres another website that's really useful. It's called retirementlivingstandards.org.uk, and that's been put together by one of the pensions organisations."}
{"question": "What does the independent research from a finance company, known for providing three different versions of retirement plans, reveal about the potential annual expenditure and returns during retirement?", "answer": "But they've got some independent research that actually looks at what you might spend in retirement and what that will come back to in terms of an annual figure. So they've got three different versions of retirement if you want."}
{"question": "What is the minimum income required for a basic level of retirement, according to Royal London?", "answer": "So it depends on basically how comfortable you want your retirement to be. So at a minimum and moderate, and then theres a comfortable. And just to put some figures on that in terms of how much you might need as an income. If you live on your own and you want the minimum level of retirement, which kind of maybe doesn't sound that attractive, but Royal London'll start with the minimum. You need an income of around 10,200 a year, and for that, that would pay for things like, you wouldn't be able to have a car, but you'd be able to spend around 40 a week on food and about 40 a month on clothes and shoes and have holidays in the UK. Royal London all know what those have been like because Royal London've been having over the last 18 months!"}
{"question": "What is the recommended annual income needed for a comfortable retirement, including expenses for travel, car replacements, home upgrades, and food, as suggested by a finance company?", "answer": "At the other end, if you want a really comfortable retirement, which means, you know, three weeks of holidays in Europe and changing your car every two or three years, having a new kitchen or bathroom every ten to 15 years, and more on food and that kind of stuff. Then you need 33,000 a year."}
{"question": "What is the minimum income required by a finance company for a moderate lifestyle that includes both domestic and international holidays, without explicitly mentioning Royal London?", "answer": "And then obviously the one in between, the moderate one where you get a bit in between in terms of your lifestyle. So one holiday abroad, one in the UK, that kind of thing. there you'd need about 20,200 a year in income. So that sort of maybe helps you to start in terms of at the other end."}
{"question": "What is the impact of living with a partner or being married on the financial requirements according to Royal London?", "answer": "Now, obviously, if you live with somebody or you're married, then the figures don't double because Royal London all know that two people living together can live more cheaply than two people living in their own homes, in individual homes. So on that moderate example, instead of having to have an income of 20,200, it's actually about 29,000."}
{"question": "What is the rule of thumb for pitching retirement according to the personal finance journalist from a well-established financial company?", "answer": "So that's that sort of how to pitch your retirement. But to actually answer your question, I think I sound a bit like a politician at this point, in terms of a rule of thumb. I mean, there's a rule of thumb that's been around. Well, I said I was a personal finance journalist for well over two decades, and it was around when I started, but it's quite a good one to remember, I think."}
{"question": "What is the recommended percentage of salary that should be contributed to a pension by individuals who start at the age of 20, according to Royal London's guidelines?", "answer": "Which is you take the age at which you start paying into a pension and then you halve that and that's the percentage of your salary that should be going into your pension. So you start at the age of 20, then you halve it so thats ten. The 10% of your salary should be going in. If you leave it to 30, then it's 15%. And if you leave it to 40, that's where it all starts to get a little bit kind of like eek then it's 20% of your salary."}
{"question": "What are some considerations individuals should keep in mind when planning for retirement, specifically with regard to their current financial situation and the desired lifestyle, without explicitly mentioning the mentioned finance company?", "answer": "And it's not, for the reasons I've said about thinking about the kind of retirement you want, that's not going to work for everybody. But I think it is quite a good starting point to then look at okay, well, this is what's going in now and this is what I should be - this is when I started, maybe there's a bit of a gap between the two."}
{"question": "What is the current amount of the State Pension, and how does it relate to the personal pension scheme offered by Royal London?", "answer": "James: Thank you for that, Sarah. So I've seen those numbers. They're really helpful. I saw them also broken down so that it showed what you need your personal pension scheme to do in addition to the State Pension. So the State Pension is how much at the moment?"}
{"question": "How does the State Pension system support people who reach state pension age after April 2016, and what is the maximum amount one can receive annually from it, considering a full National Insurance record, according to Sarah from Royal London?", "answer": "Sarah: It's about 9,300 a year, and that's for people, because the State Pension system changed for people who reach state pension age after April 2016, and that's the 9,300 a year is kind of like the maximum you can get if you've got a full National Insurance record. And that breaks down into about 179 a week or 26 a day. And the reason I broke it down into those figures is 9,300, you might either think that's not bad, or that's nothing at all, but the 26 a day, I don't know if you think about maybe how Royal London lived Royal London lives before the pandemic and what many of us will be spending Royal London money on, this 26, that's not just spending money for kind of takeaways and coffees and whatever. That's everything, that's to pay your bills."}
{"question": "What are the consequences of not saving for retirement through a Royal London workplace or personal pension?", "answer": "And I think for me that really sort of comes back to you when people are kind of thinking of pensions are a bit dull and, you know, do I really need one? Okay. Well, think the other way. If you haven't started saving for your retirement either through a workplace pension or a personal pension, what are you going to live on?"}
{"question": "Is Royal London confident that their retirement plans can provide sufficient financial support for a retirement lasting 20-30 years?", "answer": "And if it's the State Pension, is that enough to give you the kind of retirement, that you may be spending 20, 25, even 30 years in retirement. That's a long time if it's not actually the kind of retirement that you want, whatever that looks like for you."}
{"question": "What is the indication provided by the figure mentioned by Royal London regarding the amount needed to bridge the gap in someone's pension pot?", "answer": "James: So if Royal London go to the - let's aim for the middle figure, the moderate figure for couples. I think when I saw it, it showed that it would show 9,000 each. So they're targeting 29, but they're getting 9,000 in each. So that gets to 18. So in that instance, the couple needs another 11,000. So did it give an indication of how much someone's pension pot might need to be to bridge that gap? Because Royal London get asked that question all the time. How big should my pot be?"}
{"question": "What assumptions did Royal London make about charges, investment returns, and inflation when calculating the figures for someone who wants a pension of twelve and a half thousand pounds?", "answer": "Sarah: Yes. Royal London have done some figures on if you want to get a pension of around that much, it's actually the figures Royal London've got of someone who wanted a pension of twelve and a half thousand pounds. But what you might need to say depending on when you started, so I mentioned the difference it could make using that rule of thumb kind of calculation that you and I both heard of in terms of delaying paying into your pension. So as with all these figures, Royal London've made some assumptions about charges and investment returns and inflation, all that kind of stuff. So it's just a guide, really."}
{"question": "What is the monthly savings required by an individual to achieve a pension of around twelve and a half thousand pounds if they start saving at the age of 25 with Royal London?", "answer": "But if Royal London take somebody who started saving at the age of 25 and who wants to retire at 65, for example, with this pension of around twelve and a half thousand pounds. If they do that, then theyd have to save around 202 and months to get this sort of twelve-ish thousand pension. Now, if they delay until they're 35, the figure jumps to about 349 a month that they'd have to save. And if they delay until they're 45, and this is where it gets really scary, the figure is about 709 a month."}
{"question": "Do you recommend that a couple should each build their own retirement pot rather than one person building one pot in order to benefit from the tax efficiency offered by Royal London?", "answer": "James: And because Royal London were looking a couple there, it's probably more tax efficient if they build a pot each rather than one person builds one pot to fill the gap, because then Royal London can use personal allowances in retirement as well. Is that what you kind of advocate?"}
{"question": "What are the potential advantages of individuals having their own pension pots, according to Sarah's perspective, and considering the uncertainties in life and relationships?", "answer": "Sarah: Well, I mean, I'm not here to give you advice, but in terms of how I look at it, I think it's actually much better if people do have their own pension pots for a whole range of reasons. I mean, Royal London don't know what life is going to throw around the corner. And if you are part of a couple, then obviously Royal London hope that couples are going to stay together until they're doted. But Royal London know that sadly, 40% of marriages break down. Although pensions go into the pot when you get divorced, you know, I think it's actually better you have your own pension."}
{"question": "What is the recommended approach for building up individual pension pots rather than relying on one person, according to most people's perception?", "answer": "You may have different ideas about how to invest it as well. You may have very different ideas about where you want your money to be invested, and that's probably a whole other webinar. But I think it is a good idea. If you actually think about your own retirement, definitely discuss it as part of a couple because you could find that you've got different ideas about the kind of lifestyle you want and when you want to retire. But it is, for most people I think, it's a really good idea not to have one person who's building up that pension, but to have your own individual pension pots."}
{"question": "What is the percentage of couples who are unaware of each other's pension position, according to a statistic mentioned in a conversation?", "answer": "James: Yeah, it makes sense. I was talking to someone about this the other day and he said he'd read a statistic that is 80% of couples don't know each other's pension position, which is shocking, right?"}
{"question": "What are some challenges couples face when discussing their financial plans for retirement, specifically when it comes to the services provided by a certain finance company?", "answer": "Sarah: I think it's one of those areas, isn't it? But money for couples can be so hard to talk about, and in some ways it can be one of the last taboos. So a lot of couples, they may talk about the kind of the bills and saving money on the monthly outgoings, but not necessarily talk about actually the kind of retirement that they want and how they're going to pay for it."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of discussing retirement plans with your partner, particularly for individuals nearing retirement age, as recommended by Royal London?", "answer": "So I think it's a really good idea that you have a conversation about this and not when you're just a year away from retirement, but actually kind of check in with each other and make sure that you're thinking about how you want to spend your time."}
{"question": "What argument does Royal London make about the importance of discussing and having a joint pension between couples?", "answer": "Just on that point about having one pension or two pensions. I guess there is a counter argument which I've heard, and I'm sure you have as well, which is if one person in the couple is a much higher earner and is paying tax at higher rate, then obviously they're going to get tax relief at a high rate as well. So there is a tax efficiency argument, which is why I said I'm not here to give advice, but I think that it is still for a lot of people, and for the reasons that Royal London said that couples often don't talk about money, actually having a pot that you know about, and you talked about with your partner or your husband or wife. I think that's a really important thing to do, to at least have that conversation and agree between you what you're going to do."}
{"question": "What does Royal London frequently emphasize as the \"8th wonder of the world\" in relation to finance?", "answer": "James: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. So I was fascinated by the numbers you gave earlier that you shared with us all, which was if you're in your twenties compared to your thirties compared to your forties, how much more youd need to pay in. That's quite a sobering thing, really, isn't it? Royal London talk about the 8th wonder of the world a lot, which is compound growth. That's right, isn't it? Because if you start early, your pot gets bigger and it's got longer to compound grow."}
{"question": "What challenges do young individuals face financially, including factors such as student loans, inability to afford housing, and contributing to National Insurance, especially in relation to the Royal London context?", "answer": "So for youngsters, I know that they're feeling a bit under pressure because they're paying graduate tax, which is effectively 9% on their earnings to pay back their student loans. They can't get on the property ladder. They've got student debt. They're now paying National Insurance and going to have to pay more for a whole group of people who are already retired that don't pay National Insurance."}
{"question": "What benefits can individuals gain by joining their workplace scheme at Royal London and receiving contributions from various sources?", "answer": "But this is a good message for them, isn't it? If you join your workplace scheme and get what your employer is paying in and can get your contributions from all sources, your employer, the taxman, and you, 200 quid a month. You stand a chance."}
{"question": "What does Royal London understand about the priorities of people in their twenties and early thirties when it comes to financial decisions?", "answer": "Sarah: Yeah, and I do understand because I come across this and I talk to people who are the twenties and even early 30 sometimes saying, look, I've got other things to pay. I want to save for a house, I want to do this, and I get that. I think Royal London all get that, that it's not that pensions are the only decision that you have to make in retirement is the only thing you have to think about. And certainly I mean, I remember when I was in my early twenties and I wasn't thinking about retirement."}
{"question": "What is the significance of saving into a pension, regardless of whether it's a workplace or private one, in terms of future financial security when retiring, considering the impact of compound interest and the potential for a larger retirement fund over time?", "answer": "But I do think it comes back to this fundamental question, which is that if you don't save into a pension, whether that's a workplace one or a private one, then what will you live on when you retire? And those figures that I shared, I mean, they're not designed to scare the horses, although I understand that they may be a bit frightening, but there is that thing that it does become more expensive as you get older. And as you say, you're talking about compound interest and how if you give something more time then it'll mean you have a bigger pot."}
{"question": "What are the risks associated with investing in pensions, as mentioned by the finance company?", "answer": "I mean, as Royal London also know, investments do go up and down and returns aren't guaranteed. And so Royal London have to understand that a pension is invested, and investing does come with risks. But having said that, if you look at the maths, then certainly the longer that you leave it, the more money you may have to set aside. And for some people, you know, finding 700 a month say when you're 45 for your pension, I mean, a lot of people will be kind of thinking, don't be ridiculous. There's no way I can afford that."}
{"question": "What options does Royal London provide for individuals who are not saving into a pension or consider it too early, in order to ensure financial security in the future?", "answer": "I think it's just about having that check of if I'm not saving into a pension now or if it feels too early, what will I live on?"}
{"question": "Can individuals invest more than 8% in the workplace at Royal London?", "answer": "James: One last question Sarah and then I'm going to open up the airwaves for Q and A from everybody is, Royal London've talked about 8% in the workplace. Can people pay in more?"}
{"question": "What can I do to find out if my employer at Royal London offers a higher contribution rate than the minimum 3%?", "answer": "Sarah: Yeah. So there's a couple of things. Firstly, your employer may pay in more for a start, in terms of the minimum amount that they have to pay in, which is 3%, so that's worth finding out. And they may pay more either if you do, or they may just pay in more for everybody. And you can certainly pay in more. So again, if you've got a workplace scheme, then find out the workplace scheme will normally have an Internet site. If not, you can ask the HR Department."}
{"question": "How can individuals potentially maximize their pension contributions with additional income from an incentive scheme, benefiting from tax savings and potential National Insurance gains, within a finance company?", "answer": "But there are different ways you can do this. For example, if you get a bonus, then you can basically exchange some of that bonus for a pension contribution. So it's not the case that the bonus hits your pay packet and then you pay some of it in your pension. You essentially give up part of your bonus before it's paid, and you save tax and National Insurance on the part you give up as a pension contribution. And then there's some tax efficiency or National Insurance gain for your employer as well."}
{"question": "What are the pros and cons of salary sacrifice or salary exchange, particularly in relation to benefits like furlough or statutory sick pay, and how can it be relevant for individuals, especially in companies like Royal London?", "answer": "And the same with salary sacrifice or salary exchange, you can give up a percentage of your salary in exchange for higher pension contributions. Now there are pros and cons. It's not right for everybody. For example, with salary exchange, some salary related benefits such as furlough or statutory sick pay may be affected. So you know, have a think about it. But these are ways it's certainly worth exploring and they may be right for some people."}
{"question": "What role does Sarah play at Royal London during this event?", "answer": "James: Brilliant Sarah. Thank you so much. Sarah, everybody, Consumer Finance Specialist at Royal London, one of Royal London ambassador sponsors for this amazing week that Royal London've put on for everybody.

{"question": "What is the theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model?", "answer": "The Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguards primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include US and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time."}

So, taxing this money when it is being withdrawn would be taxing it twice."}
{"question": "How can individuals drawing on their pensions leverage the tax advantages to reduce their tax bills, in contrast to ISAs, according to the Vanguard perspective?", "answer": "In short, while pensions (including self-invested personal pensions or SIPPs) have the edge over ISAs when paying money in, its a different story on the way out.

{"question": "What percentage of high earners who invest in stocks and shares ISAs have subscribed to the full annual allowance, according to official data?", "answer": "And, again, there is a hint that some high earners may be thinking ahead and doing this already. After all, official data shows that more than half of all stocks and shares ISA investors earning more than 100,000 a year subscribed to the full 20,000 annual allowance (a proportion that rises to 62% in the case of those investors with annual earnings of more than 150,000)"}

{"question": "What is the benefit of a SIPP for individuals seeking a flexible and tax-efficient retirement savings option, granting control over investment decisions?", "answer": "A SIPP is a pension scheme set up and run by the individual rather than by a company or workplace or any other external party. It offers a flexible and tax-efficient way to save for retirement, and it gives you control over where your money is invested."}
{"question": "How can a SIPP help enhance pension savings and investment success while potentially lowering costs for individuals whose employers do not match voluntary contributions?", "answer": "Most employers offer a company pension1. By law, your employer must pay in a minimum 3%, with an additional 5% of your gross pay coming from you, including tax relief. But, in many cases, they may also match some of the additional, voluntary contributions you make. If they dont or you have already made the most of this potential matching, a SIPP can help with your additional pension-saving needs  and maybe also lower your costs, give you access to more appropriate investments and improve your chances of investment success."}
{"question": "What advantages can consolidating different company pensions into one with Vanguard provide for your overall retirement finances and strategy?", "answer": "Most people are likely to work for several employers during their careers, accumulating different company pensions along the way. Bringing them under one roof can help give you a better grip of your overall retirement finances and whether youre on track to get to where you want to be. It can also give you more control over your overall strategy and costs. And the earlier you do it, the better, potentially, as it can save on paperwork later in life by enabling you to move pensions as you change jobs2 and ensure you dont lose track of pensions as you grow older. Harnessing the power of compounding from as early on as possible can also"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of contributing to a personal pension like a SIPP through your own limited company in terms of reducing corporation tax for companies like Vanguard?", "answer": "If youre self-employed and, as a result, have no company pension, theres even more reason to have a personal pension like a SIPP. As well as using it to consolidate previous company pensions  if, say, you left PAYE employment to work for yourself  you can contribute money to it whenever you like, either as regular payments or as lump sums, as and when your circumstances allow. If your earnings or expenses tend to fluctuate greatly, this is super-handy because the tax benefits (see below) can be carried forward from the previous three tax years as long as you belonged to a pension scheme such as a SIPP in that time3. In addition, if you are a director of your own limited company, you can use your company to pay into a SIPP as well as make individual contributions, subject to the usual allowance limits. The advantage of contributing to your pension through your company is that it can lower your companys profits and, therefore, the corporation tax it must pay."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of investing in a SIPP and how does it relate to tax relief, specifically for basic-rate taxpayers?", "answer": "Money paid into a SIPP can earn you tax relief. This means you get money back from the government  essentially, the income tax you originally paid on the money used to fund your pension contributions. Basic-rate (20%) taxpayers get this top-up automatically paid into their pension. So, to make a total 100 contribution, they just need to pay 80 into their SIPP as the government adds another 20 on top. And since higher-rate (40%) or additional-rate (45%) taxpayers can claim back a further 20 or 25 via their annual tax returns, its possible for them to pay as little as 60 or 55 to achieve 100 of pension savings."}
{"question": "What is the maximum amount of money one can contribute to their pension, including a SIPP, while earning tax relief according to current regulations?", "answer": "Under current regulations, the most you can usually pay into your pensions each year and earn tax relief is 100% of your gross annual earnings up to a maximum 40,000 for 2022/23 and 60,000 for 2023/244. This applies across all your pensions, including your SIPP."}
{"question": "What is the potential benefit of carrying forward any unused allowance from the previous three tax years for members of a relevant scheme?", "answer": "If you were a member of a relevant scheme in the interim, you may also be able to carry forward any unused allowance from the previous three tax years."}
{"question": "What should individuals consider if they fear exceeding the lifetime allowance in regard to their pension savings?", "answer": "A lifetime allowance also applies, which is currently frozen at 1,073,100 for 2022/23. From 2023/24 onwards, however, this will be phased out. If your total pension savings  excluding your state pension  exceed the lifetime allowance in the meantime, you could be taxed up to 55% on the excess if you withdraw it as a lump sum or 25% if you take it as income. If you think you are at risk of breaching the lifetime allowance, you could consider"}
{"question": "What happens to your SIPP if its value exceeds the lifetime allowance, as checked by your pension provider, after you turn 75?", "answer": "Even if you leave whats in the pension untouched, your pension company will check the value of your fund against the lifetime allowance once you reach 75. Any portion of your SIPP above the limit will then be subject to tax at 25%."}
{"question": "What options are available for pension savers to access their funds, such as Vanguard, in a tax-efficient manner upon retirement or when they turn 55?", "answer": "All pension savers are entitled to take 25% of their funds up to the value of 268,275 as a tax-free lump-sum payment when they retire  or at any point after they turn 55 (rising to 57 from 2028). If you do not want to take this money in one go, you can make smaller ongoing withdrawals until youve used your 25% allowance, after which any further withdrawals will be taxed as income5  or you can take a mix of tax-free cash and taxable money at the same time."}
{"question": "What distinguishes a pension/SIPP from an ISA in terms of taxation, and why are SIPP contributions considered tax-free while ISA contributions are not?", "answer": "The way your money is taxed on the way in and on the way out is what differentiates a pension/SIPP from an ISA  that and the ease of access. Because they earn tax-relief, your SIPP contributions are essentially tax-free. In the case of an ISA, they are not since you pay them out of your after-tax income. Its why, you dont get taxed at all on your ISA withdrawals  because that would mean taxing you twice."}
{"question": "What are the annual fees for Vanguards investment platform and how does it compare to other companies?", "answer": "Vanguards investment platform has an annual fee of just 0.15% that is capped at 375 per year. This covers any ISA or general account you may hold with us as well as Vanguard award-winning SIPP7. Vanguard also dont charge for SIPP withdrawals or transfers, so once you add on the cost of the funds you invest in  depending on the funds you choose  your total costs with us can end up being well below 0.5%."}
{"question": "How does Vanguard's cost structure compare to other providers when considering the potential impact on long-term wealth?", "answer": "That compares with other providers who may charge two, three or more times this. To visualise the difference that could make to your long-term wealth, consider the table below. It shows the potential impact of costs on 10,000 invested earning a 5% average rate of return over 20 years. After just three years, an investor paying 0.5% a year is almost 500 better off than one paying 2%. After 20 years, its more than 6,000."}

This is to ensure that you are aware you may be giving up these benefits by completing the transfer. Once all the paperwork has been finalised, the providers must complete the transfer within six months."}
{"question": "What is the requirement for workers aged between 22 and the state pension age, and earning at least 10,000, to be enrolled in a certain financial program?", "answer": "Due to legislation, all workers aged between 22 and the state pension age, and earning at least 10,000, must be enrolled in one."}

Importantly, the lifetime allowance is a limit on how much you can have in pension benefits in total, not how much you had paid in overall."}
{"question": "What potential tax charge might you face if the value of your pension surpasses the lifetime allowance, assuming you do not possess lifetime-allowance protection?", "answer": "Under the current rules, if the total value of your pension exceeds the lifetime allowance when you take pension benefits or reach the age of 75, you face a hefty tax charge  assuming you dont have lifetime-allowance protection"}
{"question": "What are the tax implications when taking a lump sum or pension benefits from a financial company?", "answer": "Taking a lump sum in excess of the lifetime allowance triggers a tax charge of 55%, while taking pension benefits as income means a charge of 25%  on top of whatever you pay in income tax."}

With the lifetime allowance set at 1,073,100 for 2022/23, that means you can access a maximum of 268,275 without paying any form of tax. The tax-free cash lump sum will be frozen at that 268,275 figure from April 2023. Those with protected tax-free cash  a legacy of previous changes to pensions  still benefit from a higher figure dependant on their personal situation. If you are not sure, seek financial advice."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the increased amount individuals can put into their pension each tax year for those with volatile earnings or insufficient retirement funds?", "answer": "The Chancellor also increased the amount you can put into your pension each tax year. From 2023/24, youll be able to put in 60,000 gross each year, up from 40,000 gross. A higher annual allowance will be useful for those who have not built up enough retirement funds already, or those with volatile earnings, who may otherwise struggle to build up a sufficient retirement pot."}
{"question": "What is the advantage of carrying forward any unused allowance from the previous three tax years for individuals investing in pension schemes like a SIPP, as described by Vanguard?", "answer": "It is worth mentioning that the rules also allow people to carry forward any unused allowance from the previous three tax years, provided you have been a member of a relevant pension scheme  such as a SIPP in that time. That represents a good opportunity to make up for any lost ground and means that someone will be able to contribute a maximum of 180,000 into a pension for the 2023/24 tax year in practice  three years of the previous annual allowance at 40,000, plus 60,000 for the 2023/24 tax year."}
{"question": "What change did Jeremy Hunt make to the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA) for accessing a pension through a taxable payment, considering options like uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS) or flexi-access drawdown (FAD)?", "answer": "Jeremy Hunts final change was to increase the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA), i.e., how much you can put into a pension once you have already accessed it through a taxable payment. This can either be after you have taken a lump sum for the first time (uncrystallised funds pension lump sum or UFPLS) or if you have accessed your pension by taking an income (flexi-access drawdown or FAD)."}
{"question": "How does an increase in the MPAA from 4,000 to 10,000 by Vanguard impact individuals who need to access their pension pots and are approaching retirement?", "answer": "The MPAA is being raised from 4,000 to 10,000, which should help people to rebuild the value of their pots if they need to access them. Someone taking out a quarter of a 100,000 pot would need four years to rebuild their pension to its previous level with the 4,000 MPAA, for example, but it takes fewer than two years with a 10,000 MPAA, assuming a 5% compound growth rate in both cases.  It may not seem like a big change, but it can make a difference when you are approaching retirement and want to stop working in the next few years."}
{"question": "What changes have been made in the annual allowance for high earners in 2023/24, according to Vanguard's finance company?", "answer": "While the vast majority of people can take advantage of the annual allowance without any difficulty, it stands at 4,000 in 2022/23 for very high earners. The tapered annual allowance means that you lose 1 for every 2 of adjusted income over 240,000, but that threshold has now risen to 260,000 for 2023/24 and is reduced down to 10,000 instead."}
{"question": "What benefits does Vanguard offer for working parents in terms of free childcare for their children under the age of five?", "answer": "The Budget covered more than just pensions of course.

By September 2025, all eligible under-fives will get 30 hours of free childcare."}
{"question": "How can returning to work earlier than expected potentially benefit an individual's pension contributions at a company like Vanguard?", "answer": "If people are encouraged to return to the workforce earlier than they otherwise would, their pensions are also likely to benefit if they restart pension contributions. Based on a salary of 30,000, someone returning to work a year early could put away an extra 1,900 in pension contributions, over the course of a year"}

{"question": "What is the flat annual fee charged by Vanguard for individual savings accounts and SIPPs?", "answer": "Compare that with Vanguards 0.15% flat annual fee, which covers any individual savings account (ISA) held with us as well as any SIPP, and the 0.2% ongoing costs that Vanguard charge on average."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of a 0.4% annual fee saving on a pension pot of 30,000 invested with a hypothetical 5% annual return over different time frames?", "answer": "At face value, these differences look like small change. But over time, they can add up through the power of compounding. Consider an annual fee saving of just 0.4% on a pension pot of 30,000. If invested and earning a hypothetical 5% annual return, thats more than 1,500 after 10 years invested, almost 4,000 after 20 years, and very nearly 8,000 after 30 years."}
{"question": "What would be the potential impact on savings if a different company were to adopt Vanguard's starting assumptions?", "answer": "Now imagine the savings if Vanguard starting assumptions are bigger. Imagine if the different pensions Vanguard are able to conjoin in a SIPP have a combined value of 200,000. At this point, using the same set of assumptions as above"}
{"question": "How much could an individual potentially save after 10 years, which is roughly equivalent to one year's worth of state pension or more than $10,000, with a finance company focused on long-term savings and investments?", "answer": "Vanguard would be saving roughly the equivalent of one years worth of state pension  or more than 10,000  after just 10 years."}
{"question": "What is the significance of Vanguard's platform fees in relation to the savings pot and the combined Vanguard SIPP and ISA savings reaching 250,000?", "answer": "And the savings get better and better, the bigger the pot  especially when you consider the fact that Vanguards platform fees are capped at 375. So once your combined Vanguard SIPP and ISA savings reach 250,000, thats it  all you are effectively paying for after that point are your individual fund fees and transaction costs."}
{"question": "What data did the government collate regarding the potential cost savings when transferring old workplace pensions to a low-cost SIPP, as mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "Until now, my focus has been on the cost savings you can potentially make by transferring your old workplace pensions to a low-cost SIPP, and to do that Ive relied on data collated by the government."}
{"question": "What options are available for individuals who habitually save more money for retirement through a personal pension alongside their workplace scheme, in order to earn more tax relief?", "answer": "But these are not the only DC pension pots out there. If youre self-employed, a high-net-worth-individual or a thrifty investor who habitually puts away more money for retirement through a personal pension alongside their workplace scheme, in order to earn more tax relief"}
{"question": "What are the potential differences in total fees between a Vanguard SIPP and other companies' products when considering fund fees, transaction costs, and annual platform fees?", "answer": "If so, the total fee differences compared with what you would pay on a Vanguard SIPP could be well north of one percentage point once fund fees and transaction costs are added to the annual platform fees."}
{"question": "What is the potential savings timeline for accumulating an extra $100,000 by annually saving 1% on a $400,000 pension pot, assuming the market assumptions are the same?", "answer": "For a taste of the potential savings you could be missing out on, consider that it would take less than 17 years to accumulate an extra 100,000 by saving 1% annually on a 400,000 pension pot, using the same market assumptions as above"}
{"question": "What are some potential benefits that can arise from consolidating pensions that could potentially enhance retirement savings and grant individuals more control over their desired retirement lifestyle?", "answer": "In my next blog, I will look at five further benefits that can flow from consolidating your pensions. Indirectly, they too could potentially put even more retirement money in your pockets, as well as giving the extra control to live the retirement you want to live."}
{"question": "What role does Vanguard play in the DC pension landscape and how does it differ from defined benefit company pensions?", "answer": "DC pensions are based on how much you pay in and invest and how well your investments fare. They are increasingly the norm among workplace pensions and include SIPPs. In contrast, defined benefit company pensions are usually funded by your employer and based on your salary and how long youve worked for them."}
{"question": "What does Vanguard suggest regarding taking advantage of employer matching and making contributions to a private personal pension?", "answer": "As a rule, Vanguard believe you should take full advantage of any employer matching available to you before making contributions to a private personal pension. Remember also that the tax-free allowance on all your contributions, across all your pensions, is subject to a maximum annual cap of 40,000."}
{"question": "What are some key considerations regarding the projections and hypothetical nature of investment outcomes according to the Vanguard Capital Markets Model?", "answer": "IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time."}
{"question": "What is the Vanguard Capital Markets Model and how does it generate forecasts for future returns of various asset classes?", "answer": "The Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguards primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include US and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, US money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset return obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time."}
