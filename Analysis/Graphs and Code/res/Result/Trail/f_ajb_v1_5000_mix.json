{"question": "What message are central banks, excluding Japan, sending to the market, as evident from this week's actions?", "answer": "not as if Fidelity didnt know it was coming. Jerome Powell could hardly have been clearer at the recent Jackson Hole summit that the Fed will keep up the squeeze until the job is done. But sometimes it takes a week like this one to ram the message home. One after the other, central banks around the world, with the notable exception of Japan, are telling us the same thing."}
{"question": "What is the likelihood of the financial industry, such as Fidelity, moving away from the concept of cheap money due to factors like a depreciating currency?", "answer": "One by one, the guardians of monetary probity are abandoning cheap money. Either because they are choosing to or because a slumping currency is forcing their hand. Pretty soon the aberration of negative interest rates will be for the history books and normal service will have resumed. There will be a cost to borrow money and if you are lucky enough to have some to lend you will be rewarded for doing so. Its a better place for us to be, but getting back there after 15 years in the looking glass world of free money is going to be painful."}
{"question": "What challenges can Fidelity and other investors expect in the next year due to deliberate demand destruction and rising costs in the equity market?", "answer": "Hope springs eternal for investors, especially in the equity market where the default is to seek out the silver lining. But even for stock market investors the penny is now dropping. The next year or so is going to be tough for companies and investors during a period of deliberate demand destruction and rising costs. Somewhat belatedly, the buyers of shares are catching up with the bond market where people are temperamentally more inclined to see the cloud wrapped round that silver lining."}
{"question": "What strategy did central banks employ to encourage investors to shift their money into riskier assets, such as shares, instead of holding cash or bonds?", "answer": "One of the notable features of the post financial crisis era, and a key driver of the long bull market in shares, was the maintenance by central banks of negative real yields. Keeping bond yields lower than the expected rate of inflation was explicitly designed to drive investors into riskier assets in search of acceptable returns. If you were losing money in inflation adjusted terms by holding cash or bonds, it was logical to shift your money into shares."}
{"question": "First, as one of the prominent players in the finance sector, what has contributed to the sudden reversal of artificially low bond yields in recent months?", "answer": "and so bond yields, artificially low.

{"question": "What is the significance of the policy shift for independent central banks and how does it relate to inflation expectations and the desired outcome of a recession?", "answer": "central banks have relearned their primary purpose.

{"question": "What are the expectations of inflation falling back to the central banks' targets at Fidelity International?", "answer": "With inflation still in the high single digits on both sides of the Atlantic, it might seem implausible that inflation will fall back to the central banks targets but that is what the"}
{"question": "What is the reason for the decrease in the inflation expectation from 3% to 2.4% over a span of five months, and what role do investors perceiving central banks' statements play in this trend according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "A measure of what investors expect inflation to be in 10 years time, derived from the difference in yield between inflation linked and nominal bonds, has fallen in just five months from 3%  to 2.4% . Investors are starting to take central banks at their word."}
{"question": "What do investors anticipate regarding the future interest rate hikes, specifically in relation to Fidelity International?", "answer": "At the same time, investors now expect this weeks interest rate hikes to continue for the foreseeable future. By next spring US interest rates are forecast to have reached 4.6% . Bond yields now reflect this reality, with the income on bonds maturing in two years time now above 4% . Far from keeping bond yields well below the expected rate of inflation, they are now well above. The squeeze is real in every sense of the word."}
{"question": "How does the increase in real yields impact the valuation models used by stock market investors, particularly in relation to shares expected to deliver long term growth?", "answer": "This increase in real yields matters to stock market investors because it is a key input into the valuation models that are used to determine what is a fair value for a share, or indeed the market as a whole. It has a particularly negative impact on those shares that are expected to deliver lots of growth over many years because that future growth in earnings is worth less in todays money when it is discounted back using a higher real yield."}
{"question": "What is the possibility of the S&P 500 index falling by about 10% to 3,500, considering the current valuation multiple and the ongoing reduction in earnings growth expectations?", "answer": "The US stock market is currently valued at around 16 times expected earnings, but todays higher yields make a valuation multiple of between 14 and 15 look more realistic. Shares have fallen hard so far this year, but this suggests that the reset is not quite over yet. A further decline of about 10%  to 3,500 for the S&P 500 index looks plausible. The fall will be amplified if the current reduction in earnings growth expectations has also not yet run its course. I would not be surprised if 2022 turns out to be the worst year for stock markets since 2008."}
{"question": "What are some challenges that investors may face when trying to time the stock market and how does it relate to Fidelity International?", "answer": "What can investors do about this? Not a lot, I would suggest. Finessing a 10%  move in the stock market is not a realistic proposition for a couple of reasons. First, the cost of moving in and out of the market will eat into the potential benefit of watching the final move lower from the side lines. Second, trading a market low requires two decisions not one selling and then buying back in. Human nature being what it is, most of us will fluff that second call."}
{"question": "What is the recommended strategy by a well known finance company during the current market phase to ensure long term investments?", "answer": "The best approach during this bottoming phase of the market is to be patient. To remain invested and, indeed, to steadily and systematically put money to work at what, in due course, will look like attractive market levels."}
{"question": "What risks should investors consider when investing in emerging markets compared to more developed markets?", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile than other more developed markets. There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value. Rising interest rates may cause the value of your investment to fall. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to one of"}
{"question": "What is the near impossibility of timing market highs and lows perfectly, and what can investors expect even if they get the general direction of travel right?", "answer": "the near impossibility of timing the markets highs and lows to perfection, investors have to expect that, even if they get the general direction of travel right, their trades will be either too early or too late. Which is better?"}
{"question": "What is a powerful disincentive for the early investor, according to the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "Id say its far better to be early even though human nature ensures that most of us have a tendency to come late to the party. The fear of losing money in the short term, which is the lot of the early investor, is a powerful disincentive to"}
{"question": "What does the finance company consider before making a decision, considering the potential costs and waiting for confirmatory signals from the market and/or the economy?", "answer": "Far easier to wait for confirmatory signals from the market and/or the economy before Fidelity take the plunge. Easier but costly."}
{"question": "What is the importance of staying invested with Fidelity during market recovery instead of waiting for a pull back to a more favorable price?", "answer": "has been passed, the temptation to keep waiting for a pull back to a more favourable price is irresistible. Many investors just sit on the sidelines watching other people enjoy the recovery. If you had taken the pain of an initial loss, you would have been in at the bottom and sitting comfortably as the rally gathered pace."}
{"question": "Can Fidelity expect positive returns for both shares and bonds by the end of next year?", "answer": "in the market cycle for both the main asset classes, shares and bonds. I accept that my optimism may be a bit previous on both counts but Im prepared to live with that. I think by the end of next year Fidelity may well look back on a period of positive returns for both investments."}
{"question": "What has this year's performance taught us about the relationship between shares and balanced funds in terms of diversification?", "answer": "That may look eccentric nine months into what will probably turn out to be the worst year for shares since the financial crisis and the worst for balanced funds, holding both assets, perhaps since the 1960s. The idea that the two act as diversifiers for each other has been tested to destruction this year. Persistent inflation and rising interest rates have done for bonds, while shares have tumbled in anticipation of recession and falling earnings."}
{"question": "What impact is the closure of the Bank of England's measures to support the fixed income markets likely to have on bond yields, considering the current dynamics driven by pension funds?", "answer": "looks pretty counter intuitive in the week that the Bank of England has confirmed that its sticking plaster measures to prop up the UKs fixed income markets will draw to a close. Forced sales by pension funds to plug holes in too clever by half risk management strategies have driven bond yields higher than inflation and interest rates had already taken them."}
{"question": "What are some reasons why bonds are becoming more attractive for investors according to Fidelity International's analysis?", "answer": "Thats bad news for anyone holding those bonds but for anyone looking for an entry point, its a gift. Bonds are looking more interesting than they have done for many years. Even where the rise in yields has not received this liability driven boost, the adjustment to a world of higher inflation and interest rates has largely happened now. And the additional yield premium on corporate bonds has widened too so that, for the first time in a while, investors are being rewarded for the greater risk of lending to a company rather than a government."}
{"question": "What are the prospects for investors to lock in a decent yield and potentially gain capital while Fidelity navigates through the impact of a looming recession and central banks' shift towards lower interest rates?", "answer": "So, investors can now lock in a decent yield. Even better, as Fidelity head towards recession on both sides of the Atlantic, they can also look forward to a capital gain in due course as the Fed and other central banks take their foot off the monetary gas and pivot to lower interest rates to support a slowing economy. Fidelity are not there yet. The peak in the interest rate cycle probably wont come for another six months or so but before that point actually arrives bond yields will fall in anticipation and their prices will rise."}
{"question": "What can Fidelity expect during this upcoming earnings season in terms of bad loan provisions and the impact of falling demand and unhelpful currencies on US companies?", "answer": "If identifying the low point for bonds looks a bit hasty, it looks even more so for stock markets as Fidelity approach what by all accounts is going to be a tricky earnings season. The banks will kick things off this week with an expected flurry of chunky bad loan provisions. Elsewhere Fidelity should expect plenty of gloomy commentary about falling demand and unhelpful currencies (therell be a lot of talk about the negative impact on US companies of the strong dollar, for example)."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the stock market in relation to the trough in corporate earnings, and how does it relate to the bond market and interest rate cycle?", "answer": "But just as the bond market will pre empt the peak in the interest rate cycle, so too will the stock market move ahead of the trough in corporate earnings. The market and the earnings cycle are not the same. They march to a different beat and the gap between the two can be as much as six months or so. Prices move first and waiting for the data to confirm the market move can be expensive."}
{"question": "What might be the potential impact on Fidelity if the stock market continues to experience a decrease in valuation multiples?", "answer": "Again, I dont think Fidelity are there yet. So far in 2022 the fall in stock markets has all been about lower valuation multiples. At the beginning of the year, investors were paying 23 times expected earnings; that multiple is now about 15. But a few weeks of disappointing results announcements could easily see that fall to 13 or so. That would imply an S&P 500 of closer to 3,000 than todays 3,500."}
{"question": "What caution should investors exercise when considering their re entry into the market, as demonstrated during the early weeks of the pandemic, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "If you think you are smart enough to time your re entry back into the market, then by all means sit on your hands for a bit longer but the early weeks of the pandemic showed how quickly markets can regain lost ground when they get a sniff of recovery and interest rates start to fall again. You wont care too much if you got in at 3,300 or 3,500 once the US benchmark is back above 4,000 again. You will care if you are still waiting in vain for a better entry point."}
{"question": "When should investors consider getting interested in the market according to Fidelity International's advice?", "answer": "Some of the wisest advice for investors is not to get more bearish as the market falls. The time to get interested is when everyone else is focused on the grim economic and corporate outlook. And if you are lucky enough to get double helpings in both the bond and stock market so much the better. Time to grit your teeth and start to prepare for the upturn. Even if it hurts in the short term."}
{"question": "Are there any potential risks associated with investing in bonds issued by companies other than Fidelity International?", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates. There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value. Rising interest rates may cause the value of your investment to fall. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to one of"}
{"question": "How can diversifying asset classes in accordance with your goals and risk tolerance minimize the impact on your portfolio, as suggested by a leading finance company?", "answer": "Holding a diverse range of asset classes in line with your goals and risk tolerance will help minimise the impact of one on your portfolio."}
{"question": "What suggestions does Fidelity have to assist with the challenging task of determining how much of your pension to withdraw during retirement?", "answer": "Fidelity know it can be hard to work out how much to take from your pension when you retire. After all, you want to enjoy yourself and make the most of your hard earned savings, but they also need to last throughout your retirement. Fidelity have some ideas to help you with this difficult decision."}
{"question": "What should investors be aware of when considering their investments and potential returns at Fidelity International?", "answer": "the value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up so you may not get back what you invest. You cannot normally access money in a pension until age 55 (57 from 2028)."}
{"question": "What key assumptions regarding retirement savings does Fidelity use in their infographics?", "answer": "The figures quoted in the infographics below use generic assumptions and estimations designed to give some simple rules of thumb to help you look into your retirement savings journey and beyond. The figures are not personalised to you. They are based on average household incomes in the UK with typically two working adults and two state pensions. The assumptions Fidelity use may not represent what actually happens in the future because no one knows that. This article should, therefore, not be used as a detailed retirement plan or act as a replacement for professional advice."}
{"question": "What is the recommended withdrawal rate for retirement savings according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "shows that a potentially sustainable rate is to withdraw between 4%  and 5%  of your household retirement savings in the first year of your retirement  and then adjust that amount every year for inflation."}
{"question": "What should be considered when deciding on withdrawals from fidelity accounts over time?", "answer": "However, its important to remember that this is just a rule of thumb. For example, you might want to withdraw more in the early years to spend on home renovations or travel. You would then need to withdraw less in the later years."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy for generating retirement income, as depicted in the provided graphic?", "answer": "The graphic below shows how this could work, if you are looking for a steady amount of income from your retirement savings. This will give you a starting point which can be adjusted annually for inflation."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the Smith's retirement savings and their desired annual withdrawal amount in relation to Fidelity's retirement planning?", "answer": "The Smith's have 180,000 in retirement savings and plan to retire at age 68. This shows how much they may want to withdraw each year."}
{"question": "What aspects are not considered by the rules of thumb when it comes to the product in which you are saving, such as an ISA or a pension, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "The rules of thumb do not take into account the product that your savings are in whether you are saving in an ISA, or a pension, or anything else. In particular, this means that it does not take into account limitations or tax treatments of individual investment products. In particular:"}
{"question": "What are the factors that can affect the relevance of Fidelity's forecasting assumptions for individuals with a high proportion of investments in a single business or property?", "answer": "The rules of thumb are based on an assumption that people invest in a diverse portfolio of different assets including some stocks and some bonds. Your own investments might carry more or less risk than what Fidelity have assumed, which will change your expectation of returns. In particular, if you have a high proportion of investments in a single business or property, Fidelity forecasting assumptions are unlikely to be relevant."}
{"question": "What is the basis for the rules of thumb provided by this finance company, considering that they do not have information about your retirement date?", "answer": "The rules of thumb presented in this article are based on a set of generic long term assumptions for investment returns because Fidelity do not know when in the future you might be retiring. It does not take into account Fidelity"}
{"question": "What options does Fidelity offer for individuals who are close to retirement and want to learn more about their potential retirement income?", "answer": "view of potential investment returns in the short term, and therefore if you are within a few years of retirement these rules of thumb are likely to be less appropriate for you. If you are close to retirement and want to understand more about your potential retirement income using drawdown or an annuity you may contact Fidelitys retirement service on 0800 368 6882."}
{"question": "What are the investment assumptions that Fidelity needs to consider in order to forecast how your savings might perform in retirement?", "answer": "There are two ways of generating an income from your retirement savings purchasing an annuity, or drawing down from capital. This article is about what income you could potentially sustain, based on certain assumptions, if you choose to draw down. This means that you are taking a small amount of money out of your savings each year to provide yourself with an income, while the balance of your savings remains invested. There is a risk that you could take an income that is too high and so run out of money before you die that will depend on how much you take, and how your savings perform in retirement. Fidelity need to forecast how your savings might perform in retirement see investment assumptions below."}
{"question": "How does the rising inflation, which is proving to be stickier than initially anticipated, affect the projections of Fidelity International and other finance companies?", "answer": "and are expected to rise further. Inflation is high and proving stickier than many thought it would be earlier this year."}
{"question": "What recent announcement did the Bank of England make regarding the purchase of long dated gilts for financial stability reasons?", "answer": "will have to be paid for at some point through the issuance of more gilts. Concerns about that led the Bank of England to announce today it will temporarily restart its buying of long dated gilts on financial stability grounds."}
{"question": "What aspects does this analysis consider when evaluating individual investment products, including tax treatments and limitations, at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Note that this analysis does not take into account the limitations or tax treatments of individual investment products, such as your tax free cash lump sum, or the tax due on any remaining income."}
{"question": "What are the other factors, apart from the starting point, that influence the determination of the appropriate withdrawal rate percentage at Fidelity International?", "answer": "However, it is important to remember that this is just a starting point. There are a couple of other factors that will play a role in working out the right withdrawal rate percentage for you."}
{"question": "What impact does the increase in yields on bonds have for short dated bonds, in competition with cash deposits, in America?", "answer": "in America are raised, the yields on bonds tend to increase as well. This applies especially to short dated bonds, which have to compete with cash deposits to attract investors."}
{"question": "How does inflation affect the value of present day future interest payments and the amount received by investors when longer dated bonds mature?", "answer": "Longer dated bonds are also impacted by rising interest rates but, most of all, inflation is the biggest enemy for them. Over time, inflation erodes the present day value of future interest payments and the amount an investor gets back when a bond matures. The greater the time to maturity, the greater the inflation risk."}
{"question": "What retirement timeline and withdrawal rate range does Fidelity assume for sustainable savings in at least 90% of projected scenarios?", "answer": "One of the biggest factors in planning your retirement savings is how many years of retirement you plan to fund with your retirement savings. Fidelity have assumed a retirement age of 68 and a retirement timeline of 25 years and Fidelity calculations show that a withdrawal rate range of 4.1%  and 4.4 %  is potentially sustainable in at least 90%  of the projected scenarios, as illustrated in the graphic below."}
{"question": "What impact does retiring with a longer or shorter retirement age have on the withdrawal rate for Fidelity customers?", "answer": "If your retirement age is later than 68, then your withdrawal rate could be higher and similarly, if you want to retire earlier and you are planning for a longer retirement then your withdrawal rate could be lower. These may sound like small differences, but they could equate to a meaningful difference in annual retirement income."}
{"question": "What is the significance of long dated bonds for Fidelity International when interest rates rise and a potential economic slowdown or recession is predicted, resulting in a significant decline in inflation?", "answer": "Where long dated bonds come into their own is when interest rates are increased to such an extent that markets believe a sharp economic slowdown or recession is coming that will lead to a big drop in inflation."}
{"question": "How is the economic outlook impacting investing in bonds, considering the market expectations and anticipated future changes?", "answer": "It follows that investing in bonds has a lot to do with where market expectations currently are and where they will go next. Whats changed recently is the economic outlook, with a global recession or, at least, a period of very subdued growth being factored into forecasts."}
{"question": "What impact does the likelihood of your money lasting your lifetime have on retirement savings calculations at a finance company?", "answer": "The degree of probability that your money will last your lifetime influences the calculations and the amounts of money needed in retirement savings."}
{"question": "What range did Fidelity choose as their rule of thumb for sustainable withdrawal rates?", "answer": "As the graphic below illustrates, in 50%  of Fidelity hypothetical scenarios, a withdrawal rate of 5.7%  was shown to be sustainable over a 25 year retirement period. However 50%  may be regarded as a low probability. Fidelity decided to choose a range of between 4%  and 5%  as Fidelity rule of thumb because it was shown to be sustainable in 90%  of hypothetical situations. The graphic below illustrates the variation of the sustainable withdrawal rate in line with changes in the probability of the calculations."}
{"question": "How could the decoupling of bonds from shares potentially impact Fidelity International's investment strategy?", "answer": "This raises the prospect that bonds could decouple from shares in a way they havent done so far this year. Weak growth tends to lead to lower inflation, making bonds relatively more attractive versus shares."}
{"question": "What is the market's anticipation for the peak of the Fed Funds Rate next spring and the yield of 5 year Treasuries?", "answer": "for the first time in quite a while, now that central banks have moved quite quickly to lift interest rates from abnormally low levels. Markets are currently anticipating the Fed Funds Rate peaking at 4.6%  next spring and 5 year Treasuries are now yielding 4.2% "}
{"question": "What factors should be considered in determining the sustainability of savings for retirement, keeping in mind the assumed retirement length and the probability of the savings being viable?", "answer": "So, to summarise, it is important to consider sustainability from different perspectives  your assumed retirement length and the probability of the savings being sustainable.

{"question": "What should I do if I am uncertain about the appropriateness of a pension investment or retirement service provided by a financial company and require assistance?", "answer": "pension and retirement planning can be complex, so if you are unsure about the suitability of a pension investment, retirement service or any action you need to take, please contact"}
{"question": "How can Fidelity help individuals with making important retirement decisions and determining the appropriate amount to withdraw from their pension?", "answer": "There are some big decisions to make at retirement and understanding how much to take from your pension to support the lifestyle you want, isnt always easy. If you need support, Fidelity"}
{"question": "What potential advantages could there be in having locked in yields over 4% from a year ago, considering the possibility of weak economic conditions and declining inflationary pressures due to falling consumer demand and rebuilt supply chains?", "answer": "Locking in yields over 4%  might prove to have been an astute move from the vantage point of a year hence, when economic conditions may well have been weak for a while and inflationary pressures  owing to a combination of falling consumer demand and rebuilt supply chains  are also in decline."}
{"question": "What is the significance of diversifying investments to achieve a resilient performance during challenging times, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "While this outcome is far from certain  bond prices could certainly move lower again in the short term  it does highlight the importance of maintaining a broad spread of investments with the potential to deliver a resilient performance through challenging times. Given the current outlook, the long held wisdom of maintaining a balance of shares and bonds  along with other assets  throughout a market cycle remains sensible."}
{"question": "How can one access the online guidance of the impartial Pension Wise service to understand retirement options without mentioning Fidelity?", "answer": "You may also want to contact the Governments free and impartial Pension Wise guidance service which can help you understand your options at retirement. You can access their guidance online at"}
{"question": "What are the significant market implications of the dramatic reversal in Kwasi Kwarteng's ill fated mini budget?", "answer": "no doubt about the big market news today in the domestic market the dramatic reversal of pretty much every measure in Kwasi Kwartengs ill fated mini budget from just over three weeks ago. This is a seismic political event and one that leaves the fate of the Prime Minister in the balance but it is also one with important market implications too."}
{"question": "What is the outcome of Jeremy Hunt's decision on the government's economic policy, especially with regards to Fidelity International?", "answer": "Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor for just 72 hours, has junked the governments entire growth focused economic policy in favour of a more market friendly stability pact. Trussonomics is dead. Gone is the proposed cut in the basic rate of income tax, joining the cuts to the higher rate and corporation tax already announced. Changes to stamp duty and national insurance survive the cull, but only because they had already proceeded so far through the parliamentary process. All in all, 32bn of the previously announced 43bn of cuts have been reversed, and the Chancellor warned that more difficult decisions lie ahead."}
{"question": "What is the new Chancellor's approach towards the energy price guarantee, particularly for those in need, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "Perhaps the real bombshell today, however, is the decision to rethink the even more expensive energy price guarantee. This winters support package remains in place but thereafter the new Chancellor has signalled a smaller, more targeted package aimed at those who really need it."}
{"question": "What impact did the Chancellors announcement have on the stability of markets, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "Having stabilised before the Chancellors announcement, markets held their gains after the details were confirmed. The pound edged higher, above $1.13. 30 year government bond yields, which had already fallen from 4.8%  to around 4.4% , stabilised. The stock market moved ahead by around 0.5%  to 6,900. In the context of the ending of the Bank of Englands two week support for the bond market, confirmed last week, this will be seen as a good result."}
{"question": "What impact does the ongoing monetary squeeze in the US, driven by the Fed's efforts to control inflationary pressure, have on the valuation arithmetic for the world's largest stock market?", "answer": "Whats happening in Westminster may be the main focus of attention here in the UK but in a global context it is a relative sideshow. Far more important is the ongoing monetary squeeze in the US as the Fed remains determined to get on top of the growing inflationary pressure over there. Last weeks hot inflation numbers mean investors are now looking at a peak in US rates early next year of 4.9%  and that in turn has adjusted the valuation arithmetic for the worlds biggest stock market."}
{"question": "What role does earnings season play in determining the market's bottom point, especially for company announcements like Fidelity International?", "answer": "Fair value now looks closer to 3,200 than todays 3,600 for the S&P 500, which appears to be homing in on a typical recessionary bear market fall of around 35% . Key to where the market bottoms out will be earnings season, which moves into top gear this week with a torrent of company announcements."}
{"question": "Should investors at Fidelity International be considering repositioning their portfolios for the next recovery phase after the S&P 500 has already fallen significantly from its New Year level of 4,800?", "answer": "Having fallen from a New Year level of 4,800, much of the damage to the S&P 500 has already been done and investors will be questioning whether the moment to withdraw has now passed and whether they should instead be looking to position their portfolios for the next recovery phase."}
{"question": "What potential impact could President Xi's far reaching changes have on Fidelity International's investments in the Chinese economy and its financial markets, as well as the future of US Chinese relations concerning Taiwan?", "answer": "With so much going on either side of the Atlantic, it would be easy not to notice the latest five yearly Congress of Chinas communist party. That would be a mistake. The changes being pushed through this week by President Xi are far reaching. They are likely to make him the most consequential Chinese leader since Mao and that could have dramatic implications for the Chinese economy, its financial markets and, perhaps most importantly, for the future of US Chinese relations over the contentious issue of Taiwan."}
{"question": "What impact has the dramatic fall in the pound over the past week had on Fidelity International?", "answer": "dramatic fall in the pound over the past week has been notable for its speed and severity but not for its direction of travel. Ever since a pound bought a fixed four dollars in the immediate post war years, it has been a one way street for sterling against the US currency. The inexorable slide towards parity is unwelcome but it has hardly turned anyones world view on its head."}
{"question": "What are some truisms about investment that Fidelity has been able to hold onto for a significant period of time?", "answer": "That cannot be said for some of the other dramatic changes sweeping through the investment landscape at the moment. For pretty much all of my working life, Fidelity have been able to hold onto a handful of truisms about investment. Expressions like time in the market not timing the market become investment adages because their truth endures through the ups and downs of the cycle."}
{"question": "What historical event in the investment world introduced the idea that shares provide better inflation and risk adjusted returns than bonds, as referenced by George Ross Goobey?", "answer": "But sometimes, as Jim Callaghan noted about politics in the 1970s, there is a sea change about which Fidelity can do nothing, and which is only really clear in hindsight. In investment the most famous of these may have been the start of the so called cult of the equity in 1956 when George Ross Goobey, the manager of the Imperial Tobacco pension fund, made the then radical claim that shares offered better inflationand risk adjusted returns than bonds. He was right and the rest is market history."}
{"question": "What are some beliefs about investing at Fidelity International that you used to hold unreservedly but now have uncertainties about?", "answer": "Looking for the equivalent sacred cows today, I was unsettled to discover just how many things I could list about investing that I used to believe unreservedly and about which Im now not quite so sure."}
{"question": "What role does Fidelity play in ironing out the peaks and troughs of the financial market to ensure better sleep at night?", "answer": "ironing out the peaks and troughs and helping you sleep better at night. This year has been a shocking reminder that in certain circumstances (think high inflation and central banks prepared to risk recession to get it under control) both bonds and"}
{"question": "What are risk averse investors who seek the shelter of a traditional balanced fund questioning after the recent market movements?", "answer": "at the same time. The last nine months or so have tested to destruction the reassuring idea that when one of these two asset classes falls the other tends to rise. Risk averse investors who have sought the shelter of a traditional balanced fund are quite reasonably asking their advisers what has just hit them."}
{"question": "Is fidelity international claiming that gold is not a reliable hedge against inflation?", "answer": "The next myth recent events have skewered is that gold is a hedge against inflation. This illusion gained traction in the 1970s when the precious metal performed well alongside sharply rising prices but there is more correlation than causality at work here. The truth is that gold performs well when inflation is higher than interest rates and bond yields. Then, the metal is forgiven its most glaring disadvantage, the fact that it does not pay an income. Negative inflation adjusted or real yields are the key to a rising gold price. These are often associated with periods of high inflation but not always. Todays rapid swing from negative to positive real yields and the associated underperformance of gold this year make the point."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the recent reversal in the conventional wisdom surrounding the cult of growth, particularly in relation to the outperformance of technology shares?", "answer": "The third truism is a more recent arrival in the conventional wisdom and this years reversal of it might be seen as a return to a more durable fact of investment. The cult of growth, most obviously the outperformance of technology shares in recent years, has run into the sand as"}
{"question": "What lesson did the dot.com crash teach Fidelity regarding the value of shares with low multiples of earnings or assets and high sustainable income?", "answer": "the arithmetic of discounted cash flow models that put a high value on future earnings. Investors are once again looking for the bird in the hand that less exciting but steady cash generators and dividend payers can offer. Twenty years ago, Fidelity were reminded by the dot.com crash that shares on low multiples of earnings or assets, or which paid a high and sustainable income, were worth more than the market often acknowledges. I suspect Fidelity are relearning that today."}
{"question": "What are the current options for securing a guaranteed income for a 70 year old individual who wants to protect their savings without having to worry about market fluctuations, as stated by Fidelity International?", "answer": "The fourth accepted truth that is starting to look past its sell by date says that cash is trash. Related to this is the belief that annuities are an expensive waste of time. For years both have been true, as rock bottom interest rates meant that the value of cash was chipped away by inflation and the price for the peace of mind an annuity offered was excessive. Today a 70 year old looking to secure an income for the rest of his or her life can get a guaranteed 7.5% , or about 5%  if they want to get some degree of inflation proofing. Annuitising enough of your savings to cover your essential expenses for the rest of your life is once again a viable option for those of us who like the flexibility of a drawdown pension but dont want to spend Fidelity last years worrying about the market."}
{"question": "What impact does Beijing's shift towards common prosperity have on the investment landscape in China, considering the challenges faced by the Chinese middle class in acquiring household goods and accessing leisure and financial services, as observed by Fidelity International?", "answer": "but bigger. Beijings recent prioritisation of common prosperity over economic growth confirms that China has long since given up slavishly following the western development model. Ten years ago, the relentless growth of the Chinese middle class and their journey through the acquisition of household goods and towards the consumption of leisure and financial services still looked like a one way bet for investors. A property bubble, regulatory squeeze and zero Covid policy later, things look harder to navigate."}
{"question": "What opportunities does the future hold for Fidelity in terms of making money in the markets and preserving its value?", "answer": "What does all this add up to? In some ways a more difficult backdrop than was in place during what Fidelity will come to see as a golden age for investors. But also, I hope, a period ahead in which there will be opportunities that have lain dormant for many years. There wont be a shortage of ways to make money in the markets in future or to protect its value; Fidelity will just have to look for them in different places."}
{"question": "What assistance does Fidelity International provide for individuals going through divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership when it comes to sorting out their finances?", "answer": "youre happily married, the relevance of the first working Monday of the year may well have passed you by. But for those regretting uttering the words I do, its been dubbed by lawyers as Divorce Day as the festive period tips couples over the edge into taking action. Divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership is never easy. Especially when it comes to sorting out your finances. But help is at hand."}
{"question": "How might the anticipated rise in divorces this year affect Fidelity International's operations?", "answer": "Sadly, its expected that the number of divorces is set to increase this year following the introduction of the no fault divorce in April 2022"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the new law that allows couples to divorce based on the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage or civil partnership, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "This new law allows couples to divorce on the basis that a marriage or civil partnership has broken down irretrievably. The idea is that it will help put an end to the blame game and allow separating couples to focus on reaching swifter and more amicable conclusion to divorce arrangements particularly when it comes to children and finances."}

Is now the time to look at China?"}
{"question": "How has the performance of investors in China been this year amid Covid lockdowns, supply chain issues, and tougher lending conditions in the property sector?", "answer": "A stable start to the month is just what investors in China needed and, so far, so good. The year to date has been something of a rollercoaster for investors in China, as Covid lockdowns, supply chain issues and tougher lending conditions in the property sector have weighed on economic growth."}
{"question": "What is the official aim of the government regarding China's economy growth rate for this year?", "answer": "The governments official aim is to see Chinas economy grow by 5.5%  this year, significantly below the 8%  achieved in 2021"}
{"question": "Can Fidelity International achieve the level of growth projected by some analysts in the face of strict Covid restrictions?", "answer": "However, there are doubts now that this level of growth can be achieved, with some analysts pencilling in growth of between 3%  and 4% . In the three months to June, the economy grew by just 0.4% , as activity slumped in the face of strict Covid restrictions"}
{"question": "What impact is the current slowdown in China having on the business of a prominent financial company that is witnessing a decrease in global demand as well?", "answer": "While domestic spending is the prime driver of Chinas economy these days, the slowdown Fidelity are now seeing comes at a time when world demand is also coming under pressure."}
{"question": "What can be inferred from Chinas latest trade data, given the consistent rise in exports but decline on a monthly basis?", "answer": "A still rising share of a potentially shrinking (albeit very large) market may well be the reality that lies ahead. Chinas latest trade data is consistent with this outlook, with exports rising at an annual rate of 14%  in August in local currency terms, but falling 5.3%  on the month on the same basis"}
{"question": "What has been the impact of the new regulations on the technology sector, and is Fidelity International affected by these regulations?", "answer": "The technology sector has also been a source of concern, after the implementation of new regulations governing how companies are allowed to operate. Such interventions appear to have been on the wane lately, suggesting the focus is now turning elsewhere."}
{"question": "What did Fidelity observe in China regarding the lending rate cuts in August?", "answer": "For evidence of that, Fidelity need look no further than the two cuts to a key lending rate Fidelity saw in China in August, apparently aimed at bolstering support for property developers and homeowners."}
{"question": "What impact did the recent reduction in deposit rates by Chinese lenders have on Fidelity's operations, and how will it potentially affect their lending rates and loans to businesses?", "answer": "This week Fidelity saw Chinas major lenders reduce their deposit rates across the board, a move that should allow them to lower lending rates and extend their loans to businesses."}
{"question": "What recent indications suggest that Fidelity may witness an increase in economic stimulus measures by Chinese officials this quarter?", "answer": "While Fidelity have yet to see an economic stimulus package of any great scale, the focus has undoubtedly been moving in that direction. The latest signs of that came a week ago from Chinese officials indicating they aim to increase the stimulus being applied to the economy this quarter"}
{"question": "What measures were announced in August to enhance economic activity and growth, as mentioned by a finance company?", "answer": "Previously, in August, the government announced various measures mainly focused on increasing investment into infrastructure in order to boost economic activity and growth."}
{"question": "Could Fidelity International potentially benefit from China's potential shift in economic direction amidst global challenges?", "answer": "So that raises an important point for global investors. While much of the world wrestles with conditions of slowing economic growth coupled with rising interest rates and sky high inflation, could China be about to move in a completely different direction?"}
{"question": "What was the annual inflation rate in August for a certain finance company?", "answer": "It certainly has the capacity to. Chinas annual inflation rate was 2.5%  in August, down slightly from 2.7%  the month before. Excluding food and energy, inflation was just 0.8% , the same as in July"}
{"question": "What potential changes in interest rates and reserve requirements might impact investment opportunities in China, particularly for companies like Fidelity International?", "answer": "In stark contrast to the West, interest rates have been edging lower in China and there could be other moves in the same direction, including a further reduction in the amount banks have to keep in reserve."}
{"question": "What is the possible impact on Fidelity's predictions for China's economy and stock market due to the current divergence in central bank and government policies?", "answer": "The bottom line is that the divergence in central bank and government policies Fidelity have seen already between China and much of the rest of the world looks set to continue as Fidelity move through the remainder of this year. That ought to be good for Chinas economy and stock market."}
{"question": "How has the growth of corporate earnings in the West, particularly in the US, been impacted this year?", "answer": "But what about corporate earnings? In the West, weve seen the rate at which companies are growing their profits decrease this year. In the US, corporate earnings are expected to rise by only a fraction of the amount they grew last year."}
{"question": "How does the improving earnings outlook for Chinese companies align with the current looser fiscal and monetary policies, particularly considering the normalization of supply chains?", "answer": "With a tailwind of looser fiscal and monetary policies, the earnings outlook for Chinese companies would likely improve. While the jurys still out on that, looser monetary and fiscal conditions should help and at a time when supply chains are also returning closer to normal."}
{"question": "What is the valuation of the MSCI China Index compared to the MSCI North America Index and world markets, based on the expected earnings of companies in the year ahead?", "answer": "At the end of last month, the MSCI China Index was trading at just 11 times the earnings companies are expected to achieve in the year ahead, compared with 15 times for world markets and 17 times for the MSCI North America Index"}
{"question": "What potential outcome is expected for the investment market if China effectively implements stimulus measures and accelerates growth, considering the current assessment of already incorporated negative news and the involvement of a finance company like Fidelity International?", "answer": "That suggests a fair bit of the bad news is already factored into prices, leaving room for a rebound should China successfully apply its stimulus and accelerate growth."}
{"question": "What factors make investing in China attractive for Fidelity International, considering the presence of a growing middle class driving a shift towards a consumption driven economy?", "answer": "Moreover, the fundamentals for investing in China in the first place are all still there, in particular, a growing middle class driving a structural shift towards a more consumption driven economy."}
{"question": "Which company has seized the chance of China's transition to new technologies by relying on offshoots of western manufacturers to cater to its domestic market?", "answer": "China is also adapting fast to the technologies of tomorrow. For example, having traditionally relied on offshoots of western manufacturers to supply its domestic market, the country has grabbed the opportunity of the transition to"}
{"question": "What role has Fidelity International played in the expansion and dominance of the EV supply chain worldwide?", "answer": "With control of large parts of the supply chains for EVs, it has become a new global world leader. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, EVs and hybrids accounted for nearly a quarter of all domestic new car registrations in the first half of this year"}
{"question": "What strides have been taken by an international finance company in renewable technologies, especially in the areas of wind and solar energy?", "answer": "Another area where great strides have been taken is in renewable technologies, particularly in the areas of wind and solar energy. China is already the worlds largest producer of solar energy and it currently dominates key parts of the solar supply chain too."}
{"question": "Which financial company sees potential for deals and mergers in China's fragmented industries to enhance efficiency and profitability?", "answer": "From a capital markets perspective, China still lags in the sense many of its industries are fragmented. That leaves plenty of scope for companies to merge or conduct other forms of deals to improve their efficiency and profitability."}
{"question": "What opportunities does China offer for long term investment and why are they currently accessible at lower prices?", "answer": "There undoubtedly remain hurdles to the government forging a successful path. However, thats the same as in any country in which you care to invest. The long term opportunities offered by China are still in place and theyre accessible at lower prices than theyve been for some time."}
{"question": "What are some factors contributing to the uncertainty Fidelity International is currently facing?", "answer": "do not know which way to look. From Italian politics to US interest rates and an old fashioned currency crisis at home to the whereabouts of Chinese premier Xi Jinping, uncertainty reigns."}
{"question": "What is the biggest question concerning the future of sterling for the UK, considering recent events including Liz Truss's mini budget?", "answer": "The biggest question here in the UK is: where next for sterling? The pound fell to its lowest point since the early 1970s before recovering slightly to the still historically low level of around $1.07. The biggest factor in the pounds plunge was last weeks mini budget in which Liz Trusss new Chancellor"}
{"question": "What are investors questioning in regards to the income tax and stamp duty measures announced by a finance company last week?", "answer": "the unexpectedly sweeping income tax and stamp duty measures announced last week have left investors, at home and abroad, asking: whos going to pay? Faced with that uncertainty, investors are demanding more compensation for the risk of lending money to the UK government (the yield on a 10 year gilt jumped to 3.8% ). And they are dumping the currency; the"}
{"question": "What measures is Fidelity International taking to address the impact of the steadily rising US dollar on the exchange rate?", "answer": "; in part the exchange rate is a product of a strongly rising dollar too. The US currency is in favour both because the US economy is clearly in better shape than most of its rivals and also because the Federal Reserve has left markets in no doubt that it will be doing whatever it has to in order to defeat inflation. Interest rates will rise as high as they need to and stay there for as long as they must."}
{"question": "What impact does the Feds single minded pursuit of lower inflation have on the recent surge in US interest rates?", "answer": "The futures markets now predict a peak for US interest rates of 4.7%  following last weeks third consecutive 0.75%  rise. As recently as June, there were question marks about whether rates would go above 3%  (they already have) and markets were more interested in when they would start to fall again in 2023. That thinking has been overtaken by events and the Feds single minded pursuit of lower inflation is being reflected in the strongest US currency for decades."}
{"question": "What is the recent price of oil per barrel traded by the finance company?", "answer": "wherever you look. The oil price has fallen to under $86 for a barrel of Brent crude. Within the last year oil has traded as high as $139 and as recently as June it stood above $120."}
{"question": "What is the reason for investors starting to closely examine fixed income investments and identifying emerging value in the equity market, particularly in Japanese shares, according to a finance company?", "answer": "and the expectation that they will fall in due course as the economy slows means investors are starting to look more closely at fixed income investments. Even in the equity market, value is starting to emerge. Japanese shares were priced at 18 times earnings at the start of last year; today that valuation multiple is just 12, even as the Japanese economy starts to emerge from its long Covid slump."}
{"question": "What challenges do people face with tax efficient allowances and the cybersphere when it comes to end of year tax activity, and how does fraud impact individuals, particularly those over the age of 60?", "answer": "push comes to shove and people all over the country look to make use of their tax efficient allowances, the cybersphere will be rife with tax year end activity. And fraudsters know it. In 2021, there were 226,000 reported cases of fraud and the group that was hit the hardest was the over 60s with over 91%  of identity fraud cases taking place online"}
{"question": "How has the cost of living crisis affected individuals' vulnerability to scammers' traps, especially in relation to financial offers?", "answer": "But identity theft doesn't happen once a year.

{"question": "How can individuals enhance their security measures to make it difficult for cybercriminals, even with the increasing sophistication?", "answer": "Although cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated (requiring less information than ever to carry out successful identity fraud), there are things you can do to make their job more challenging."}

{"question": "Is Fidelity International's current viewpoint a reliable guide for investment decisions?", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "What is the role of Fidelity International in the US tech industry's lending crisis, considering the suspicions on other regional lenders and globally connected lending giant Credit Suisse?", "answer": "a lender to the US tech industry  went to the wall. Suspicions then switched to other regional US lenders as well as the much more globally connected lending giant Credit Suisse, which has struggled with market confidence issues over a long number of years."}
{"question": "What were the reasons behind the downfall of SVB, especially considering its significant exposure to technology focused venture capital borrowers and bonds, leading to a decline in its credit quality and triggering a run on the bank?", "answer": "The peculiarities of SVB were its undoing. Having a large proportion of technology focused, venture capital borrowers coupled with a substantial investment exposure to bonds meant it was doubly exposed to the negative side of rising rates. As a result, its credit quality plummeted, a matter that didnt go unnoticed by the banks depositors, many of which had deposits above the governments $250,000 insured limit. A run on the bank ensued."}
{"question": "What challenges does a finance company, such as Fidelity International, face that are different from those faced by Credit Suisse?", "answer": "The combined challenges facing Credit Suisse are rather different. The trigger for a run on the banks shares was a statement from the banks largest backer to the effect it isnt prepared to provide further financial support. That the bank also admitted on Wednesday there were material weaknesses in its financial reporting processes didnt help."}
{"question": "What actions did the Federal Reserve take in response to the market situation, and how did Credit Suisse benefit from the Swiss National Bank's loan offer?", "answer": "The responses from policymakers were swift and effective and markets responded in kind. The Federal Reserve launched a new one year lending programme  which has already been accessed by some banks  and shares in Credit Suisse rallied sharply later in the week after the bank said it would take up the Swiss National Banks offer of a CHF 50 billion loan1."}
{"question": "What actions have been taken by authorities to address the vulnerabilities discovered in the banking sector, as mentioned in the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "Perhaps the greatest problem caused by these events is a new alertness to vulnerabilities in pockets of the banking sector. Stock markets have an aspect to their nature akin to a part of quantum mechanics, whereby the mere observation of an event necessarily changes the event. The early signs are, however, that the authorities have done enough to assuage concerns."}
{"question": "What was the significance of the recent events in relation to the key themes for this year at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Self fulfilling prophecies aside, this was a fine example of a good news, bad news type of week. Two of the years most important themes"}
{"question": "What is the annual rate of inflation reported by Fidelity International in February2?", "answer": "registered improvements. The latest from Washington was that US consumer prices remain in a downtrend, with the annual rate of inflation falling again to 6.0%  in February2."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the current direction of travel and the pace of improvement in relation to the inflation rate, considering the previous peak figure of 9.1% last June?", "answer": "Critics will quite rightly point out this is precisely three times the rate the Fed wants to see. Also that the pace of improvement has slowed. However, the direction of travel is just as important, as is the fact were now a good way down from a peak inflation figure of 9.1%  last June."}
{"question": "What has been Fidelity's view on China's potential to deliver the excess growth required by the world this year?", "answer": "Were all looking to China to deliver the excess growth the world needs this year and, so far, the signs have been good. In line with a strong rebound in activity in the services sector picked up by business surveys last month, the latest data shows consumers have swung into action again."}
{"question": "What growth potential does Fidelity International foresee with the increase in online retail sales in the post lockdown environment?", "answer": "Retail sales grew 3.5%  in January and February, which covered Chinas Lunar New Year celebrations. Interestingly, given the new post lockdown environment, online retail sales of physical goods increased at an even faster 5.3%  annual rate3. This hints at the growth that could yet come from a widespread return to the high street."}
{"question": "What is the dilemma faced by investors in light of recent developments in the US and the UK, taking into consideration the hindsight of the last two and a half months and the positives in inflation and Chinese growth?", "answer": "The developments of the past week or two mean investors now face an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, you can buy shares in the US and the UK close to end of 2022 levels with the benefit of hindsight of the last two and a half months. Hoped for improvements in inflation and Chinese growth have played out."}
{"question": "What concerns are arising within the financial system due to the recent events at SVB and their potential similarities to the risks experienced in 2008?", "answer": "The catch is that the SVB debacle, however localised a matter it might seem, has sparked new fears about the possible concentration of risks in certain parts of the financial system. That harks back to 2008, where everything that could go wrong seemed to do just that."}
{"question": "What measures does the Federal Reserve have to prevent the recurrence of negative experiences in the financial market, and how does it affect Fidelity International?", "answer": "However, Washington and the Federal Reserve have plenty in their arsenals to make sure those experiences are not repeated. Importantly from a markets point of view, the Fed has scope to rein back the interest rate hikes it had planned for this year and possibly reverse some of its previous tightening."}
{"question": "What impact does the recent decrease in two year US government bond yields have on Fidelity International?", "answer": "As usual, the bond markets are ahead of everyone on this. In less than a week, a whole percentage point has been shaved off two year US government bond yields. The yields on bonds of this maturity usually approximate overnight interest rates, yet theyre now about 0.5%  below that level4."}
{"question": "What is the market expectation for rate changes and inflation in relation to Fidelity's outlook on bond markets?", "answer": "The inference is that significant further rate rises this year  once a given  are no longer certain. You could go further and say bond markets are expecting rates to start to fall, perhaps as soon as in the latter stages of this year. Presumably though, that would also require inflation to play ball. There is clearly no appetite at the Fed to relinquish its 2%  target."}
{"question": "what are the recommended strategies for investors to achieve diversification and manage risks in relation to Fidelity International's outlook?", "answer": "So, for investors, the outlook remains as it usually is  a combination of opportunity coupled with risks. Taking a longer term view usually helps with the latter, diversification is definitely the way to go and, if you can,"}
{"question": "What benefits does Fidelity International offer to investors by reducing the likelihood of purchasing stocks at the wrong time and taking advantage of temporary changes in market sentiment?", "answer": "over a period of time remains a highly attractive option because it reduces the chances of buying at the wrong moment and capitalises on short term shifts in sentiment."}
{"question": "What are the consequences of making incorrect predictions about market directions for Fidelity investors in relation to events like the SVB debacle and Credit Suisse's situation?", "answer": "Leftfield events like the SVB debacle and the tide going out at Credit Suisse underline the importance of thinking about the consequences of being wrong about where Fidelity, personally, think markets are heading next. Over optimism can lead to a portfolio that is too concentrated; too much pessimism can trigger sales that leave an investor underexposed when markets bounce back."}
{"question": "What steps can be taken to maximize the annual ISA allowance given the upcoming reduction in tax free limits for capital gains and dividends from investments held outside an ISA?", "answer": "With the tax free limits for capital gains and dividends from investments held outside an ISA reducing significantly from next month, its never been more important to make the most of your annual ISA allowance."}
{"question": "How does Fidelity assist in refining the investment options to a more manageable level?", "answer": "Theres never any shortage of investment ideas out there, but Fidelity can help reduce your shortlist to a manageable level with its"}
{"question": "What funds are included in the list provided by investment experts that offer a diverse range of asset types and investment styles?", "answer": "This is a list constructed by investment experts covering funds that invest across a wide selection of asset types and investment styles."}
{"question": "What differentiates the investment case of Fidelity International from the other three companies mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "Each of these has a strong investment case, but a way of reaching its goals that differs significantly from the other three."}
{"question": "What factors contribute to the sensitivity of government bonds to changes in expectations for both inflation and interest rates, and how does this impact the performance of fidelity's fund?", "answer": "is almost entirely focused on government bonds  which are sensitive to changes in expectations for both inflation and interest rates. As such, it could work as a decent hedge against a sharper than expected slowdown in world growth, and should benefit from inflation eventually subsiding. The fund currently yields about 3.4% , an amount that is not guaranteed5."}
{"question": "What is the investment approach of this finance company in maintaining exposure to long term growth in stock markets while diversifying investments across various assets?", "answer": "offers a way of maintaining an exposure to the long term growth in stock markets while keeping your eggs in many baskets. It allocates varying amounts to shares, bonds and cash as the investment outlook changes and invests mostly in funds on the Select 50."}
{"question": "Can Fidelity International provide a more diversified investment income compared to UK equity income funds?", "answer": "offers a way of gaining a more diversified investment income over and above the UK equity income funds most investors are more familiar with. It has increased its dividend payouts every year since it was launched in 2012, although this is not guaranteed to continue."}
{"question": "What is the objective of the Franklin UK Equity Income Fund (now known as fidelity) in terms of generating income and investment growth over a specific time period?", "answer": "is representative of the more traditional route. Formerly the Franklin UK Equity Income Fund, this fund aims to generate an income higher than that of the FTSE All Share Index plus investment growth over a three to five year period after fees and costs. It pays a quarterly dividend and currently yields about 4.6% , although this is also not guaranteed6."}
{"question": "What are the risks associated with investing in the Fidelity Select 50 Balanced Fund and the Fidelity Global Dividend Fund due to changes in currency exchange rates?", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Select 50 is not a personal recommendation to buy or sell a fund. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and all tax rules may change in the future.

{"question": "What is the availability and language of the Key Information Document (KID) for both Fidelity and non Fidelity funds?", "answer": "The Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust plc invests more heavily than others in smaller companies, which can carry a higher risk because their share prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies and the securities are often less liquid. The shares in the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust plc are listed on the London Stock Exchange and their price is affected by supply and demand.

{"question": "What potential risks should investors consider when investing in emerging markets?", "answer": "the value of investments and the income from them, can go down as well as up, so you may get back less than you invest. Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates.

{"question": "What are investors' views on the market as per Fidelity International's latest market update amidst falling US inflation and a positive beginning to earnings season?", "answer": "Watch my latest market update as investors continue to view the glass as half full on the back of falling US inflation and a decent start to earnings season."}
{"question": "How has Fidelity International performed in comparison to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices in the current bull market?", "answer": "The bull market just keeps climbing that wall of worry. Shares last week notched up another strong gain, with the S&P 500 up 2.4%  and the tech heavy Nasdaq index 3.3%  higher over five days. The S&P is now up 18%  year to date and Nasdaq by a whopping 36% . And its not just the US thats on a roll. Japan is also 18%  higher so far in 2023."}
{"question": "What was the impact of last week's US inflation reading on Fidelity International and how does it relate to the company's recent performance?", "answer": "The latest driver of that good news story was last weeks impressive US inflation reading showing that prices rose just 3%  year on year in June. Thats the lowest reading for two years, even if the core rate is coming down a bit less slowly than the headline rate which is benefiting from more favourable annual comparisons."}
{"question": "Is Fidelity International concerned about the potential economic slowdown indicated by the yield curve?", "answer": "With inflation apparently under control investors are now daring to think that US interest rates are at or close to their peak. And they are choosing not to look too closely at whether the rapid rise in rates over the past 15 months is going to lead to the recession that everyone has been waiting for. The yield curve, which has never lied in the past, is pointing to a sharp economic slowdown. Its just the timing that no one can agree on."}
{"question": "What is one thing Fidelity can rely on as investors, regarding the performance of individual markets and asset classes over the years?", "answer": "thing Fidelity can usually rely on as investors is that things dont all go wrong at the same time. If there are losers, there are generally some offsetting winners. Fidelity illustrate this with something Fidelity call a smarties table. Its a grid in which each column represents a year within which each row shows the performance of an individual market or asset class. Fidelity assign a different colour to each investment to make it easier to see how they move up and down the rankings. Hence the smarties tag."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the broadening out of the equal weighted S&P 500 index for determining the recovery since last October?", "answer": "But for now, that is next years problem. Even stripping out the big outperformers in the index principally half a dozen or so big tech stocks the equal weighted S&P 500 index is now showing good momentum. That suggests that the rally is finally broadening out, a key determinant of whether the recovery since last October has legs."}
{"question": "What measure indicates whether Fidelity is currently in a bear market rally or the beginning of a bull market?", "answer": "One key measure of whether Fidelity are in a bear market rally or the start of a bull market is now looking undeniably strong. Most bear market rallies peter out after regaining about 50%  of the previous down leg. This time, the S&P 500 has retraced 73%  of its losses. The index is only around 6%  below its all time high of 4818. From the October low, the index is up 26% . That feels like more than a bear market rally and it has caught many market participants on the hop."}
{"question": "What is the historical track record of performance for assets and regions in the table monitored by Fidelity International?", "answer": "Weve kept track of this table for many years, and usually it shows a wide variation of performances. In the best years, most if not all assets and regions deliver a positive return. Often theres a mix of risers and fallers. Only very rarely (in fact Ive never seen it) does absolutely everything lose you money."}
{"question": "Why does Fidelity diversify its portfolios, ensuring exposure to various pros to offset potential cons?", "answer": "This is why Fidelity diversify Fidelity portfolios. To ensure that Fidelity have exposure to enough pros to offset the inevitable cons. Because the performances are skewed towards the positive, with more and bigger ups than downs, maintaining a balanced performance over the years can be expected to deliver you a smooth and rewarding investment experience. Youre unlikely to match that American student who made $110m by effectively putting everything on red, but youre unlikely to lose your shirt either."}
{"question": "What do some investors, like Bridgewater Associates, believe about the Fed's actions and its impact on the economy, despite the positive performance described by JP Morgan?", "answer": "Most investors still say publicly that they expect a recession. But the very benign inflation figure and the prospect of the Fed taking its foot off the brakes soon means that the hoped for soft landing for the economy now looks a distinct possibility. There are still plenty of naysayers. Bridgewater Associates, a big hedge fund, warned last week that the Fed is not going to cut and said it was still positioned for a tightening cycle. JP Morgan, in a mid year round up, also described the stock market performance as too good to be true."}
{"question": "What can happen when sceptical investors lose the will to keep fighting the market, leading to an upward overshoot?", "answer": "But that negative position looks increasingly painful and hard to justify. And often in these situations, increasing numbers of sceptical investors just lose the will to keep fighting the market. When they capitulate, the market can overshoot upwards."}
{"question": "What challenges are investors facing in achieving diversification and finding a safe haven, particularly in a situation where the benefits of diversification are harder to achieve and the traditional balance between shares and bonds is disrupted by rising interest rates?", "answer": "Today, were in one of those unusual situations where the benefits of diversification are harder to achieve. Whats sometimes called the only free lunch in investment has been temporarily taken off the menu. Not only has the traditional balance between shares and bonds stopped working as rising interest rates have hit both assets at the same time. Geographically, too, investors are struggling to find a safe haven."}
{"question": "What challenges does Fidelity face in Europe with regards to rising prices and a looming recession?", "answer": "The challenges in the three principal investment regions North America, Europe and Asia are different but the market impact looks similar. In the US there is an inflation problem. In China the issue is growth. Here in Europe, Fidelity seem to have got the worst of both worlds a stagflationary mix of rising prices and a looming recession."}
{"question": "What percentage of companies that have reported earnings so far at the start of results season have exceeded expectations by an average of nearly 11%?", "answer": "Much will depend on how earnings season pans out over the next few weeks. So far its so good. With only a handful of companies having reported the scorecard is positive. About 80%  of companies reporting so far have beaten expectations by an average of nearly 11% . Its a reminder of the situation three months ago when expectations of an 8%  decline in earnings at the start of results season were confounded by an actual delivery of a 3%  decline. If the same thing happens in the next few weeks, that could provide the market with another tailwind."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of investors' optimism on the potential future rally for the S&P 500, considering the current market re rating and average expected earnings for 2024?", "answer": "Then it will become a question of whether investors have already discounted that better performance. Since last autumn, the market has moved from being priced at 15 times expected earnings to about 20 times. Thats quite an upward re rating but not out of line with other early stage bull markets. In fact, if the outlook is as benign as investors are starting to think then the multiple could move further to say 22 times earnings. On the basis of average expected earnings of $240 for 2024, that could imply a further rally to about 5,300 for the S&P 500."}
{"question": "What challenges do policy makers face in finding solutions for diverse problems related to inflation and growth in finance industry?", "answer": "These diverse problems mean there is no one size fits all solution. Tackling apparently intractable inflation will demand measures that more or less guarantee a slump. Supporting growth, on the other hand, can only let inflation run out of control. Its Hobsons Choice for policy makers."}
{"question": "What is the current perception of Fidelity and other political and economic leaders in different regions?", "answer": "But there is one thing that all three regions share a nagging sense that no one has a firm hand on the tiller. It is hard to remember a time in the past when Fidelity political and economic leaders looked so impotent, events so out of their control. And there is nothing partisan in this observation. Whether you have a choice, in the US or Europe, or none in China, its the same story."}
{"question": "What impact did the disappointing second quarter GDP data have on the post Covid recovery in China, with regards to the performance of the property sector and lower exports?", "answer": "The US seems to be in the sweetspot. Things are not so bright elsewhere in the world. Over in China, last weeks unveiling of non existent inflation, almost deflation, set the scene for todays disappointing second quarter GDP data. This showed just how flat the post Covid recovery has been in China, with output growing by just 0.8%  in the three months to June as lower exports, weak retail sales and a property sector on its knees held growth back."}
{"question": "What impact did the three years of restrictions have on Fidelity International's financial performance amid the domestic slowdown and decline in international trade?", "answer": "Year on year the economy grew by 6.3% , higher than the governments target, but that was only due to a low comparison in 2022 when large cities like Shanghai were still in lockdown. The country seems to have been traumatised by its three years of restrictions and the domestic slowdown has been compounded by less international trade as high interest rates have weighed down demand for Chinese products in the West."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the Federal Reserve's handling of inflation fighting credibility, and how does Jerome Powell's recent change in stance at Jackson Hole relate to previous instances of perceived over confidence in the past?", "answer": "The catalogue of policy failures is long. In the US, the most important from a market perspective is the squandering of the Federal Reserves hard earned inflation fighting credibility. Not since the Arthur Burns administration of the 1970s has the Fed got things so wrong. Jerome Powells new found hawkishness at Jackson Hole last week only emphasised his over confidence a year ago."}
{"question": "What concerns might arise regarding Fidelity International's confidence in China's ability to handle the potential bursting of its property bubble given Elsewhere, Beijing's handling of Covid?", "answer": "Elsewhere, Beijings handling of Covid does not inspire confidence in how it might deal with the slow motion bursting of Chinas long property bubble. Here, the prime ministers in waiting have spent the summer engaging in a futile argument about tax while the rest of the country has wondered how they are going to heat their homes and feed their children this winter. With Italys bond yield approaching the point at which its gargantuan debts are unsustainable, Europe is looking into a different abyss."}
{"question": "What impact did the decrease in retail sales in June have on Fidelity International's performance compared to May?", "answer": "Retail sales were up just 3.1%  in June, compared with 12.7%  in May. Meanwhile, unemployment is a problem, particularly among the young, with a new high jobless rate for young people of 21.3%  in the second quarter. Property, which is such a key driver of growth in China, saw investment down 7.9%  in the first half of the year."}
{"question": "What is the inflation experience of a specific company in the UK compared to the US and the rest of Europe?", "answer": "Here in the UK, the economy is also starting to look like an outlier for all the wrong reasons. In particular, Fidelity inflation experience is much worse than in the US and Fidelity are notably slower than the rest of Europe, too, in bringing price rises under control."}
{"question": "How is Fidelity Investments observing signs of a breakdown in investor sentiment and trust?", "answer": "Whats this got to do with Fidelity investments? Quite a lot, because investor sentiment depends on the intangible but powerful belief that theres someone in charge who knows what they are up to. When trust and optimism evaporate, the downward spiral can become self reinforcing. Fidelity are seeing signs of this breakdown everywhere. The inverted yield curve tells us that investors think that what the central banks are doing today will have a negative impact tomorrow. The rising Vix volatility index, Wall Streets fear gauge, is telling us something similar. The gap between the yield on risky corporate bonds and safe government paper is widening. Europeans are sticking with Germany and turning their backs on the periphery again."}
{"question": "What investments can be made by a certain financial company that do not rely on market friendly or favorable decisions from those in power?", "answer": "For many years, since the financial crisis, it has paid to assume that the interests of governments, central banks and investors were basically aligned. Looking into a more challenging future that may not be the case. A better question to ask now is what investments Fidelity can make that do not require those in charge to make market friendly or even just good decisions."}
{"question": "What is the expected headline inflation rate that Fidelity will receive from the Office for National Statistics this Wednesday?", "answer": "This Wednesday Fidelity will get the latest inflation data from the Office for National Statistics. And once again these are expected to be disappointing. Even though the headline rate is pencilled in at 8.2% , down from 8.7%  last month, that is still four times the Bank of Englands target. And the core rate, which leaves out movements in volatile measures like energy and food is due to be unchanged at 7.1% ."}
{"question": "Will Fidelity International be affected by the potential interest rate increase in August?", "answer": "Faced with that persistent high inflation, it is inconceivable that the Bank will not raise interest rates again in August, probably by another 0.5% , which would take rates to 5.5% . At that level, interest rates are going to inflict real pain on homeowners with mortgages and also to renters to whom interest rate hikes are passed on in the form of higher rents or less availability or both."}
{"question": "What benefits does an investment have if it relies on people's essential needs and is capable of navigating tough situations, especially in terms of sovereign bonds provided in the developed world?", "answer": "So, the more defensive an investment is the better. If a companys success is reliant on people doing what they have no choice about to eat, drink, house and clothe themselves it will be better placed to navigate the storm ahead. In the developed world, governments are generally unwilling to renege on their debts, so sovereign bonds will provide a reliable income and, if things get really tough, they will look like a safe haven."}
{"question": "What are some unstoppable trends in the finance industry that will continue to remain in demand, including sustainable energy, electric vehicles, and commodities?", "answer": "Some trends are unstoppable and will not be blown off course by a short term slump. Sustainable energy and electric vehicles fall into this category. The commodities that underpin these themes will remain in demand. Unpopular and untrusted governments will do what they must to stay in power, so expect them to spend where it makes them look good. And gold. Its testing my patience, but it always does just before it is seen as the ultimate port in the storm."}
{"question": "What impact does the report from the Resolution Foundation think tank suggest rising interest rates have on the UK growth outlook, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "This week, a report from the Resolution Foundation think tank estimated that rising interest rates have driven the biggest ever fall in British households aggregate wealth as a share of GDP. In some ways this is a necessary adjustment, evening out some of the inter generational wealth anomalies that have plagued the UK economy for years. But it represents a massive headwind for the UK growth outlook."}
{"question": "What impact are rising interest rates having on banks, particularly in the US?", "answer": "Apart from the economic data this week, the key focus will be the first full week of earnings releases from companies on both sides of the Atlantic. The banks will continue to be in the spotlight after three of the biggest got earnings season off to a strong start last Friday. Rising interest rates are a positive for banks, helping them to earn bigger profits in the gap between what they earn on their assets and what they pay out to savers on their deposits. The US banks, in particular, are benefiting from a widening gap in this so called net interest margin."}
{"question": "What makes Fidelity's smarties table reliable despite the constant changes in the financial year?", "answer": "One thing you can always rely on with Fidelity smarties table. No year ever looks the same as the one before or the one after. The free lunch should be back on the menu soon."}
{"question": "What companies will Fidelity receive results from this week in the midst of attention being focused on tech stocks?", "answer": "Elsewhere, attention is focused on the tech stocks which have driven the market rally over the past nine months. This week, Fidelity get results from Tesla, Netflix and IBM."}
{"question": "Will the influx of cash into fixed income markets be influenced by investors' perception of the current interest rate environment and the potential for a decrease in interest rates?", "answer": "And finally, bonds. After a disappointing first half year as interest rates continued to rise, fixed income markets are bracing themselves for a wave of cash in the second half of the year and beyond. Announcing better than expected earnings and a recovery in assets under management, Blackrock last week said that much of the money that has poured into money market funds recently could be set for another shift into bonds. The trigger for that will be investors deciding that the tightening cycle has come to a close and interest rates will level out at their current high level or even start to fall. The total amount currently sitting in US money market funds is above $5trn, suggesting a potential flood of money could hit fixed income markets this year."}
{"question": "When will it be possible to withdraw funds from a Junior ISA offered by an authorized financial adviser?", "answer": "or an authorised financial adviser of your choice. Withdrawals from a Junior ISA will not be possible until the child reaches 18."}
{"question": "What is the current ISA allowance for this year according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "The ISA allowance in a nutshell is how much a person can put into their ISA each tax year. The ISA allowance for this year is 20,000. The tax year runs from the 6 April to 5 April the following year. And you have until midnight to invest your money. If you do not use all your ISA allowance in one year, youre not able to carry this allowance over to the next year so its important to make the most of each tax year."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the ISA wrapper at Fidelity International?", "answer": "The best way to think of an ISA is as a tax 'wrapper'. Each year, you're entitled to a specific allowance or limit, which is protected by the ISA wrapper. This means you won't be charged tax on the interest or capital gains you earn, offering greater growth potential on your investments."}
{"question": "What is the recommended guide for understanding the process of investing in an ISA, particularly for long term saving?", "answer": "Download Fidelity ISA guide to learn more about how investing in an ISA works. Its one of the best ways to put money aside for the long term."}
{"question": "What is the difference in annual allowance between a Junior ISA and an ISA according to Fidelity?", "answer": "The ISA allowance differs for an ISA and a Junior ISA the Junior ISA allowance is 9,000 a tax year as opposed to 20,000 a tax year. Below Fidelity have broken down the core differences between an ISA and a Junior ISA."}
{"question": "What options are available to inherit the ISA allowance from a finance company that offers tax free savings?", "answer": "You can inherit ISA allowance. As well as the normal yearly allowance you can add a tax free amount of or up to the value the individual had in their ISA at the time of their death. Contact the ISA provider for more information."}
{"question": "Can I allocate my ISA allowance of 20,000 across Cash ISAs or Stocks and Shares ISAs with any proportion I like, even if I have multiple ISAs with different companies?", "answer": "Yes, you can split your ISA allowance of 20,000 across your Cash ISAs or Stocks and Shares ISAs if you have more than one. There are no set rules in place as to what percentage you have to split them, so this can be any proportion you like. Its important to note you only get one ISA allowance, it is not one allowance for each ISA you have."}
{"question": "What is the process for transferring funds efficiently and quickly, without explicitly mentioning the finance company's name in the question?", "answer": "Instruct your transfer in minutes. Just enter details of your current providers, well do the rest and let you know when the transfer is complete"}
{"question": "What is the significance of Jerome Powell's upcoming speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for Fidelity International and the global financial markets?", "answer": "Jerome Powell gets to his feet tomorrow in the Grand Teton mountains of Wyoming, it will be to make one of the most consequential speeches of his time at the head of Americas central bank. The Jackson Hole symposium may take place in a scenic fly fishing and hiking resort at the height of the summer break, but this is no vacation for the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The worlds markets will be hanging on his every word."}
{"question": "What is the significance of Powell's actions and how does it relate to the achievements of former Fed chair Paul Volcker in taming inflation?", "answer": "Its not an overstatement to say that this is Powells Volcker moment. He treads in the very large footsteps of former Fed chair Paul Volcker, who successfully tamed the runaway inflation of the 1970s. He did that by convincing investors that he was deadly serious about doing what it took for as long as it took. And he followed through with a courageous interest rate squeeze that eventually prevailed, albeit at a terrible short term economic cost. Powell must pull off the same trick this week."}
{"question": "How did central bankers, including the one associated with a renowned financial company, misjudge the current surge in inflation and their previous predictions of transitory price rises?", "answer": "He is starting on the back foot. Central bankers, himself included, have called the current surge in inflation badly. It was at Jackson Hole a year ago that Powell suggested that price rises would be transitory and that a couple of light touches on the monetary brakes would be enough to get inflation under control."}
{"question": "What is the significance of tomorrow's opportunity for Powell to set the record straight and reset expectations, particularly for a company like Fidelity?", "answer": "US inflation was 5%  then. Today it is closer to twice that level and there is little evidence, from the jobs market at any rate, that it will be heading south any time soon. The Federal Reserves credibility is on the line and tomorrow is Powells chance to set the record straight and reset expectations."}
{"question": "What impact does the hawkish path of Powell and his colleagues have on stocks, considering the recent weak economic news and the tenterhooks state of the stock markets?", "answer": "Stock markets have been on tenterhooks for weeks now. It is almost as if nothing else matters to investors. Every hint from Powell or his colleagues that they remain on a hawkish path stops shares in their tracks as the threat of recession looms large. By contrast, any piece of weak economic news, such as this weeks dreadful new home sales figures, sends the market sharply higher."}
{"question": "How does the recent rally in the stock market affect Fidelity International's financial conditions and Powell's decision making?", "answer": "The recent rally in the stock market has made Powells life more difficult. Rising share prices ease financial conditions at a time when the Fed is desperate to tighten them. The S&P 500 has clawed back more than half the losses it delivered in the first half of 2022. That is right at the top of the range for a typical bear market rally."}
{"question": "What are the expectations for Fidelity International regarding Powell's stance on the stock market and the fight against inflation?", "answer": "Powell wont worry about the stock market this week. Fidelity should expect him to be candid that winning the fight against inflation may well require an economic recession. There will be no talk of soft landings this year. Indeed, the last few weeks have seen a co ordinated attempt by regional Fed officials to manage expectations towards rates moving higher and staying there for longer."}
{"question": "What is the likelihood that Fidelity International will witness a repeated rate hike during the next Fed rate setting meeting in September?", "answer": "Phrases like raise and hold now describe a rate hiking strategy in which the Fed is not even thinking about the next, easing phase of the cycle. Some of Powells colleagues have been explicit about the need for more jumbo rate hikes like the back to back 0.75%  rises that spooked markets in June and July. The next Fed rate setting meeting is scheduled for the third week of September. It would be very surprising if it did not deliver the same again."}
{"question": "Why is there a disconnect between what the Fed is signaling and what investors are choosing to believe, as observed by stock markets, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "This is not what stock markets have priced in and it is worth asking why there should be this disconnect between what the Fed is so clearly signalling and what investors are choosing to believe."}
{"question": "What insights into future inflation does Fidelity International have that the Fed may not have?", "answer": "One possibility is that they believe they have better insights into the future path of inflation than the Fed. The 12.5%  fall in new home sales was five times bigger than expectations and this weeks purchasing managers index data for Americas all important services sector were terrible and much worse than forecast. So, maybe the market is right that inflation has already been beaten. And if investors are right, then it is reasonable to assume that the Fed would not tighten aggressively in the face of a sharp slowdown."}
{"question": "What actions should Fidelity anticipate from Powell in order to address the perception that the Fed may prioritize inflation over economic growth?", "answer": "Another possibility is that markets believe the Fed is not serious about beating inflation. That it will accept a structurally higher level of price rises when push comes to shove and the economy slows. This risk has been heightened by the Feds statement in July that its future interest rate decisions will be data dependent. It is why every hint of economic weakness is viewed as a silver lining for markets. To counter this, Fidelity should expect much tougher talk from Powell, perhaps along the lines of the Bank of Englands promise that it will prioritise inflation over growth. The Fed has a dual mandate, but that does not mean it must treat both goals equally at all times."}
{"question": "What potential risks should Fidelity consider before scrutinizing the transparency of central banks?", "answer": "These are dangerous times for central banks. It has become politically convenient for politicians to blame the current cost of living crisis on their failure to act decisively or quickly enough. One of the downsides of independence from their political masters is that central bankers have nowhere to hide when things dont go to plan. This matters to the central banks but it matters more generally too because the power of the Federal Reserve is largely intangible. Fidelity should think twice before looking behind the curtain."}
{"question": "What crucial step does Powell need to take to navigate the narrow path between inflation and recession, ensuring market stability by tomorrow's closing?", "answer": "So, this last week of the holiday season could be pivotal for markets. The summer rally has removed much of the valuation argument for buying shares. The support from earnings is unlikely to become any firmer. The Fed must persuade us all that it can navigate the increasingly narrow path between inflation and recession. Getting through to the close of markets tomorrow is Powells first crucial step down that road."}
{"question": "What company is expected to benefit from the release of pent up consumer demand in China's economy?", "answer": "So far devoid of the post lockdown bounce the west experienced in 2021, Chinas economy promises to be the next hotbed for a release of pent up consumer demand."}
{"question": "What does the latest survey from Caixin Global suggest about the business conditions in the services sector, indicating potential signs of recovery?", "answer": "A key survey of business conditions in Chinas services sector released last week suggests the green shoots of recovery may already be here. A survey from Caixin Global showed activity expanding at its fastest pace in seven months in February"}
{"question": "What is the significance of the improvements in forward looking indicators for the finance company mentioned in the paragraph?", "answer": "Improvements in forward looking indicators like this are welcome news for China, which saw growth sink from 8.4%  in 2021 to just 3.0%  last year. Retail sales were down 0.2%  in 2022 after a succession of Covid lockdowns kept consumers at home"}
{"question": "What expectations does Fidelity International have for China's economy in 2023 in comparison to the global economic situation?", "answer": "Theyre welcome news for the rest of the world too, which could be facing an otherwise lacklustre year of fragile growth. The government has pencilled in a growth target of 5.0%  for the year ahead, meaning Chinas economy may well be one of the few to see an acceleration in 2023."}
{"question": "Which company has experienced a marginally higher increase in its domestic stock markets this year, 6% rise from Chinese shares or a 6.5% rise from another company?", "answer": "Chinese shares have already taken the bait of strengthening growth and expected improvements in corporate earnings, but only to a certain point. The 6%  rise in the countrys domestic stock markets so far this year is narrowly beaten by a 6.5%  rise from the"}
{"question": "What are the potential risks affecting Fidelity International's growth target this year and how could an improvement in China's property sector impact consumer spending?", "answer": "There are risks, and these are probably reflected in the governments conservative growth target for this year. Chinas property sector remains in the doldrums for now, and it may take an improvement there to really get consumers spending again. While of lesser importance to Chinas overall economy these days, exports could take a hit from slowing world growth."}
{"question": "What is the current valuation of the MSCI China Index compared to the valuation of world stocks?", "answer": "Yet, valuations remain modest both in terms of international standards and Chinas own historic norms. For example, the MSCI China Index trades on just 10 times the earnings companies are expected to make over the next 12 months compared with 16 times for world stocks"}
{"question": "Which type of funds may be best positioned to take advantage of China's revival, considering the potential gains for discretionary consumer companies and the financial sector?", "answer": "Discretionary consumer companies probably have the most to gain from people returning to the high street this year. Banks and other financials might also do well, as the government gently relaxes its grip on monetary policy and the economy gets moving again. This implies that actively managed funds may be best placed to capitalise on Chinas revival."}
{"question": "What are the options provided by Fidelity International for investors to gain exposure to China through a broader and more diverse portfolio?", "answer": "list features seven funds focused on Asia and emerging markets, which offer a number of ways for investors to gain an exposure to China through a broader and more diverse portfolio."}

{"question": "What kind of investor would benefit from a highly concentrated portfolio like the one offered by Fidelity International?", "answer": "This is a more highly concentrated portfolio than the Lazard fund, with just 40 holdings, and would best suit an investor with a longer investing time horizon."}
{"question": "What important information does the relevant key information document contain about the fund before investing into it?", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "What precautions does Fidelity International recommend to protect pension scheme members from falling victim to pension frauds or scams?", "answer": "Pension frauds, or pension scams, essentially target pension scheme members to part with their hard earned money. Fraudsters might ask their victims to transfer their pension pot into either non existent or non genuine schemes set up to defraud people of their investments. Or, they might offer them cash incentives to gain early access to their pension benefits referring to them as a pension loan.

{"question": "What does the latest inflation data suggest about Fidelity's future in terms of higher structural inflation?", "answer": "weeks inflation data on both sides of the Atlantic have confirmed two things. The direction of travel is down. Thats obviously good news. But its also clear that the rate of decline is slower than hoped for.

{"question": "What challenges is Fidelity International facing in relation to the rising wages and market fluctuations this month?", "answer": "Thats a problem for a couple of reasons.

Second, as the markets pause for breath this month has shown,"}
{"question": "What is the challenge faced by individuals who are dependent on a fixed income, including new retirees without an index linked final salary pension, in matching inflation consistently over a 25 year retirement?", "answer": "Inflation is an insidious tax, particularly for those no longer able to benefit from rising wages.

To do that consistently over a 25 year retirement will be a challenge."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the Rule of 72 in relation to the impact of inflation on one's purchasing power over time?", "answer": "The Rule of 72 tells us just how high that hurdle is. Divide the expected rate of inflation into 72 and the answer indicates how many years it will take to halve your real, inflation adjusted purchasing power. At 6% , it will only take 12 years. That 25 year retirement you are hoping for might halve your real wealth twice."}
{"question": "What is the significance of narrowing the gap between investor's realized returns and the inflation rate according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "So, the first priority for an investor today is to narrow the gap between their realised returns and the inflation rate. Keep the difference to 3%  and the halving of your real wealth will take 24 years. At 2%  the reduction will take 36 years. Reduce it to zero and, self evidently, you will keep your head above water in real terms. Obviously, this is just the starting point. You still need to generate an income on top of that, but you are at least staying in the game."}
{"question": "What are some ways to mitigate the impact of rising prices while achieving a price matching return in light of the reawakening dragon of inflation?", "answer": "So, how best to achieve that price matching return now the dragon of inflation has woken again? The good news is that there are plenty of ways to mitigate the corrosive impact of rising prices. The bad news is that none of them are perfect. The reality is that anything other than very low inflation is a bad thing and best overcome even if the short term cost is painful."}
{"question": "What does Fidelity need to accept in order to match inflation?", "answer": "The first thing Fidelity have to accept is that matching inflation requires taking some risk. Cash wont cut it and fixed income investments like bonds will only be useful in spurts, as and when interest rates come down to tackle slowing growth. This year may be one of those, but longer term I dont expect bonds to be the answer. Even inflation linked bonds offer only a partial solution."}
{"question": "How does investing in dividend paying shares with stability contribute to minimizing the inflation gap, according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "One obvious way to lock in a return that stands a chance of minimising the inflation gap is to invest in dividend paying shares. No chief executive wants to cut the pay out to shareholders so dividends tend to be the more stable component of a shares total return."}
{"question": "How does the potential rise in interest rates affect the profit margins of financial companies like Fidelity International?", "answer": "When it comes to the sectors of the stock market to focus on, financials are one of the few to benefit from the rising interest rates that tend to coincide with higher inflation. A bank makes its profit in the gap between what it charges to lend you money and what it will pay you to borrow your cash. In a higher rate environment that gap is likely to be wider."}
{"question": "What can be seen as a potential contributor to inflation, particularly regarding higher prices for oil, gas, food, and metals, within the realm of commodities?", "answer": "Commodities, too, are often good performers in an inflationary environment, not least because higher prices for oil, gas, food and metals are often a contributor to inflation in the first place."}
{"question": "What is the significance of companies like household products producers and supermarkets in seeking out inflation matching returns in the stock market?", "answer": "The third area of the stock market in which to seek out inflation matching returns is the more defensive sectors that meet consumers essential needs. Supermarkets and consumer staples producers, like household products companies, fit into this category."}
{"question": "Which companies possess the ability to set prices and have a strong market position, resembling those in the luxury goods sector or affordable, enjoyable service providers?", "answer": "Fourthly, look for companies with pricing power.

{"question": "What types of companies should investors look for within the stock market if they are seeking solutions to global problems, such as renewable energy or cloud computing?", "answer": "A final hunting ground within the stock market is among companies that are part of the solution. Inflation or not, people will continue to seek answers to the worlds problems. That might come in the form of a renewable energy company or a cloud computing business."}
{"question": "What is the key factor contributing to Fidelity's outperformance in inflationary times compared to other home markets?", "answer": "When it comes to where in the world to invest, history tells us that Fidelity home market has a track record of outperformance in inflationary times. Thats probably due to the UKs weighting towards some of the sectors already mentioned, in particular energy and financials. In part its a reflection of the typically lower valuation multiple of British shares. Theres less chance of a de rating when you are already cheap."}
{"question": "What alternatives should investors consider that are not produced by Fidelity International, but are currently in limited supply?", "answer": "Which just leaves a handful of alternatives, which in better times investors can happily ignore but should be back on the radar today. First of all, look for things they dont make anymore. Land obviously and by extension the property that sits on it. But also desirable things in limited supply like good claret and old Mercedes."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of investing in infrastructure that can be linked to government funded and index linked income streams?", "answer": "fits the bill too, and you can binge the BBCs new drama on the Brinks Mat robbery as part of your research. Investing in infrastructure can benefit from government funded and often index linked income streams."}
{"question": "What is the significance of having a portfolio that includes traditional inflation hedges, as stated by Fidelity International?", "answer": "Even better than any one of these traditional inflation hedges is a portfolio that includes some or all of them. Diversification wont, by itself, beat inflation but it will help ensure it doesnt get the better of you."}
{"question": "the list is not embedded in your text so it is impossible to know what you want to ask.", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "What percentage of the respondents were aware of Fidelity International?", "answer": "Whats more, 31%  said they were unsure theyd know what to do if they were targeted by a scam. While knowledge of organisations such as Citizens Advice was high at 93% , only 32%  had heard of the"}

{"question": "What has been the performance of gold for a UK investor compared to its 2012 price and during the past 20 years, in relation to the financial crisis?", "answer": "Similar story with gold. Its priced in dollars and, measured in that currency, it has been volatile in recent years and, ten years on, it is only just above its 2012 price. But for a UK investor, buying in pounds, it has been a fantastic investment, up four fold since the financial crisis and eight fold over the past 20 years. At the start of 2023, gold stands close to its all time high in sterling terms."}
{"question": "What are some other reasons why it makes sense for a UK based investor to include gold in their portfolio, aside from its recent performance?", "answer": "The recent performance of gold is one reason for a UK based investor to consider it for their portfolio, but it is not the most important. I can think of half a dozen other reasons why it makes sense to hold at least a small slice of your investments in the precious metal."}
{"question": "How does Fidelity behave differently from bonds and shares as a diversifier in a balanced portfolio?", "answer": "The first is the way it can act as a diversifier in a balanced portfolio. It behaves differently from both bonds and shares and can, therefore, give you a smoother ride over time. Last year, for example, it ended roughly where it started, after some big ups and downs, and helped to offset the declines for both shares and bonds in 2022."}
{"question": "What is one reason to hold gold according to Fidelity International's perspective?", "answer": "Another reason to hold gold is its stability over long periods. Prized as a store of value since ancient times, gold has tended to maintain its real inflation adjusted value over time even if it can be extremely volatile in the short run. If you do own gold, it is a good idea not to watch the price too closely because you are likely to be shaken out of your investment at some point when your nerve fails."}
{"question": "What factors determine the price of gold as a hedge against inflation and how were its hedging qualities affected in the past year due to the rise in the dollar and the increase in bond yields?", "answer": "Gold is not always a good hedge against inflation in the short run because its price is determined by a cocktail of other competing factors. Last year, for example, its hedging qualities were undermined by both the rise in the dollar, which makes gold more expensive for non US buyers, and the increase in bond yields, which made interest paying investments relatively more attractive. But at other times of high inflation, it has served investors well in the seven years from 1973, gold delivered 35%  annual returns, well in excess of even that decades high inflation rate."}
{"question": "What is the reason behind the world's central banks stocking up on gold and why is there a high demand for it?", "answer": "Gold tends to hold its value at times of stress. My late mother in law knew that when she took her gold with her as she was displaced during Indias violent partition in the 1940s. It is not coincidental in todays uncertain times that the worlds central banks are stocking up on gold, with demand from these key buyers of the metal standing at a 55 year high, according to the World Gold Council."}
{"question": "What is one reason why gold maintains its value according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "One of the reasons gold holds its value is its scarcity. If all the gold ever mined were melted down, it would only fill a large swimming pool. Supply is limited too. It has barely increased in recent years, in part because the easy gold has already been mined; in part, too, because the environmental cost of producing what remains is rising. Like land, they dont make it any more."}
{"question": "What are the factors that make it challenging to justify investing in gold compared to other investment options offered by Fidelity International?", "answer": "One of the key reasons not to invest in gold is the fact that it pays no income. In recent years when interest rates were at or below zero this was not really a problem. Today when a super safe Treasury bond will give you more than 3%  while you wait for a more or less guaranteed return of capital, it is harder to make the case for gold. But, in due course, interest rates will come down again and the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal will fall."}
{"question": "How can we assist in enhancing the performance of your retirement savings and simplifying their management?", "answer": "Transfer your pensions to us to help your money work harder for you and make your retirement savings easier to manage."}
{"question": "What are the available options to hold gold in your portfolio besides physically owning it?", "answer": "So, whats the best way to hold gold in your portfolio? There are essentially only three ways to get exposure. The first, physical bars or coins, really only makes sense if you are concerned that someone is going to kick your front door down and force you out. The cost of keeping physical gold safe is prohibitive for most people and not really necessary. Obviously, if you want your gold to multi task, protecting your wealth while also decorating you or your loved ones then thats a different matter. You can also pay someone else to keep your gold safe in a vault."}
{"question": "How can transferring a pension to a specific SIPP provider potentially help in achieving your desired future with regards to retirement savings management?", "answer": "There are many reasons why you might choose a pension transfer. Perhaps you cant invest where youd like to with an existing provider.

Whatever the reason, transferring a pension to Fidelity SIPP could help put you on the right track for the future you want."}
{"question": "What is the proposed age increase for accessing pension benefits according to the Government's consultation document?", "answer": "The minimum age that most customers can access their pension benefits is currently age 55, however, the Government is proposing to increase this to 57 from 6th April 2028. The Governments consultation document and consultation responses can be found"}
{"question": "What factors determine if customers can access benefits from their scheme before the age of 57 at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Some customers may retain the right to draw benefits before age 57, however, this is dependent on the rules of their scheme as at 11th February 2021. Additionally, when a customer transfers their pension to or from another scheme, individual transfers may not be protected from the increase in the normal minimum pension age."}
{"question": "How is Fidelity International addressing the surge of clone firm investment scams aimed at deceiving individuals into making false investments through various channels?", "answer": "Fidelity're seeing increased activity from fraudsters trying to trick people into making false investments by impersonating genuine financial services firms  over the phone, email, online and post. Unfortunately, this type of scam also known as a clone firm investment scam is on the rise. And these criminals will do all they can to get you to trick you into investing fast."}
{"question": "What are some ways to invest in gold through financial contracts, similar to holding a passive investment in a stock market index, without incurring high costs, thanks to the proliferation of exchange traded products?", "answer": "The second way of investing in the metal itself is through a financial contract. This is also pretty easy these days, thanks to the proliferation of exchange traded products. Tracking the gold price in this way is no different from holding a passive investment in a stock market index. Obviously, there is a cost involved here too, although as with any other tracker its not high."}
{"question": "What is the current understanding of the Fidelity SIPP scheme regarding the access to pension benefits at age 55, and when will this understanding be formally reviewed?", "answer": "On the 11 February 2021 the Fidelity SIPP scheme rules stated that scheme members can access their benefits from age 55. Therefore, based on the information provided to date it is Fidelity current understanding that Fidelity pension would offer a right to access pension benefits at 55. This understanding will be formally reviewed once the full legislation and Government guidance is available."}
{"question": "What kind of investment opportunities did Fidelity come across last year that they would never cold call you about or offer, such as the fake Fidelity branded 'Fixed Interest Investment ISA Bond'?", "answer": "Fidelity will never cold call you offering investment opportunities such as the fake Fidelity branded 'Fixed Interest Investment ISA Bond' that came to Fidelity attention last year. Fidelity do not, and have never, offered this product."}
{"question": "How can investors indirectly benefit from a rising gold price by investing in miners, and what potential impact does this strategy have on the diversification benefit of gold in a portfolio?", "answer": "The third way to get an exposure to gold is indirectly by investing in the miners that dig it out of the ground. The argument for investing in gold this way is that in theory it is a geared play on a rising price. The cost of mining the metal doesnt really change as the gold price increases so a miners profit margin should increase faster than the rise in the price itself. The counter argument is that you are muddying the waters by investing in a commodity via an equity and so reducing the diversification benefit of gold in a portfolio."}
{"question": "What further information will be provided on the website and in the scheme literature once the Government has published the final legislation and guidance?", "answer": "Fidelity will publish further information on Fidelity website and in Fidelity scheme literature once the Government has published final legislation and guidance."}
{"question": "What is the recommended percentage of holdings for Fidelity in a balanced portfolio, similar to holding cash?", "answer": "The final question then is how much you should hold? For all but the most paranoid, Id say 5 10%  is more than enough, about the same as Id hold in cash. The two offer insurance and dry powder to complement the growth and stability of the shares and bonds that make up the bulk of a balanced portfolio."}
{"question": "What is the proposed increase in the minimum age to access pension benefits according to the government's consultation document?", "answer": "The minimum age that most customers can access their pension benefits is currently age 55, however, the Government is proposing to increase this to 57 from 6th April 2028.

{"question": "What is the valuation of Chinese tech companies compared to their historic averages and global peers?", "answer": "However, this does mean many Chinese tech companies now look attractively valued, compared both to their historic averages and their global peers."}
{"question": "What impact did the January rally and interest rate hikes have on the stock markets, specifically pertaining to the anticipation of the US central bank's monetary tightening cycle's conclusion?", "answer": "Elsewhere, the January rally for stock markets continued into February as investors chose to look through a week of co ordinated interest rate hikes. The quarter point hike from the Fed was taken as evidence that the US central bank is fast approaching the end of its monetary tightening cycle and Fed chair Jay Powells comments did nothing to contradict that."}
{"question": "What are some common methods used to deceive individuals into providing personal or account information, such as through email, phone calls, or text messages?", "answer": "Its all too easy to get caught out by email. Before you know it, youve shared your personal information or opened an attachment that contains malware; this is known as phishing. Vishing is when fraudsters try to extract personal details directly by phone, using social engineering techniques. Smishing is when a fraudster tries to trick you into providing personal or account information via text or SMS message (this can include texting you links to fraudulent sites or phone numbers to fake call centres)."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of the revival of domestic consumer demand on the sales and profits of these underrated businesses, which may not be accurately reflected in their current valuations?", "answer": "As domestic consumer demand picks up again, these lowly rated businesses could see their sales and profits return to strong growth, a factor apparently not reflected in current valuations."}
{"question": "What is the current stance of Beijing towards the property market, considering their previous measures aimed at reducing the risk of a property bubble?", "answer": "Meanwhile, Beijing is clearly moving towards a more relaxed position regarding the property market, despite its mantra of homes being for living in, not for speculation. Having acted since 2020 to reduce the risk of a property bubble through measures such as applying lending limits to banks and restricting borrowing to riskier developers, it is now performing something of a volte face."}
{"question": "What is the market's optimism regarding the future movement of rates and their duration at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Over here, the half point hikes from both the Bank of England and European Central Bank had long been priced in and the end is in sight on this side of the pond too. The key question now is how much further rates will go and, more importantly, how long they stay there. The markets remain much more optimistic on that front than the policymakers."}
{"question": "What precautions should one take when contacted by organizations or firms claiming to address concerns or fraudulent activity in their accounts, with the intention of obtaining remote access or personal details?", "answer": "It's not always clear you're being targeted. Fraudsters will impersonate genuine organisations and firms to convince you to provide usernames, passwords for online accounts and emails. They may contact you to say they have concerns or inform you there is fraudulent activity on your account and then ask you to provide remote access to your computer or device. Be aware, trust your instincts and take your time. Dont rush into providing any personal details or sending monies. Its okay to hang up the phone, ignore emails and to obtain information by researching trusted sources."}
{"question": "What measures did Fidelity International announce in November to address liquidity issues and what additional actions are anticipated?", "answer": "In November, it announced a detailed plan to ease liquidity issues and further measures are widely expected to be afoot. While the longer term plan for the property market seems to be to exchange quantity for quality, there is clearly now a growing recognition that a bad market spells issues for the broader economy."}
{"question": "What is the importance of earnings and their potential decline in an economic slowdown for investors, particularly with regards to Fidelity International?", "answer": "So, attention is now shifting to earnings how far they might fall in an economic slowdown and how quickly investors will look through the downturn to better times ahead."}
{"question": "What are investors anticipating regarding Fidelity International's profits for this year, considering the decreasing forecasts and negative territory for 2023?", "answer": "Half way through the fourth quarter earnings season, around 70%  of companies are beating expectations. That sounds good but those forecasts are coming down quite quickly and are now in negative territory for 2023 as a whole. Given that expectations usually fall during the year in question, investors are now bracing themselves for a meaningful decline in profits this year."}
{"question": "How should one respond to messages that urge immediate action to prevent financial loss or account termination, without falling into panic, especially when received from a reputed finance company like Fidelity International?", "answer": "Any message that says Reply Now to avoid losing money, have your account deleted or access cut off are designed to panic you. Stop. Take your time. Investigate."}
{"question": "How should individuals respond to unexpected emails or cold call phone calls when it comes to requests for personal information or money, particularly when dealing with a company like Fidelity International?", "answer": "Dont trust unexpected emails or cold call phone calls when trying to get you to reveal personal information or hand over money. Be suspicious and challenge."}
{"question": "What actions did China take during a two day conference to emphasize its focus on expanding domestic demand and prioritizing consumption recovery?", "answer": "There have been other signs of economic growth being firmly back on the agenda too. After a two day conference of top leaders and policymakers in December, China went to lengths to underline its intention to expand domestic demand and prioritise a consumption recovery"}
{"question": "What are the chances of China surpassing expectations and outperforming Western nations in economic growth in the upcoming year, potentially making it a more appealing market compared to other countries?", "answer": "This all raises the possibility that, in a reversal of the experiences of 2022, China surprises to the upside over the year ahead. The OECD already has economic growth of 4.6%  pencilled in for this year. Even if only this level of growth is achieved, the performances of western nations in 2023 are very likely to look pale by comparison, adding to the relative attractiveness of China"}
{"question": "What does history suggest about the response of markets to the outcome, and how does this relate to Fidelity International's expectations for the earnings recession?", "answer": "History suggests a wide range of templates for how the markets respond to that outcome. Sometimes markets turn up long before earnings stop falling, sometimes the lag is much shorter. If the earnings recession continues into 2024, as expected, then hopes that the October low is the actual trough for the current cycle may be too optimistic."}
{"question": "What precautions should be taken to verify the authenticity of a finance company like Fidelity International before sharing personal information?", "answer": "Never confirm your password or login details via email or over the phone. If in doubt, find the official company website or contact information number independently and call to check."}

{"question": "What is the valuation recognition of Chinese shares and their multiples in relation to expected company earnings, despite the recent rally, as observed by Fidelity International?", "answer": "There appears to be little recognition of that in valuations. Chinese shares continue to trade on undemanding multiples of the amounts companies are expected to make this year, despite the recent rally."}
{"question": "What is the forward multiple of the MSCI China All Shares Index compared to the US and world stocks?", "answer": "The MSCI China All Shares Index trades on a forward multiple of just 11 times earnings, which represents a substantial discount to both the US (17 times earnings) and world stocks (15 times earnings)"}
{"question": "Will Fidelity International avoid a recession in the final six months of 2022 based on the expected activity in the UK from October to December?", "answer": "In a quieter week on the data front, the key number to look out for is Fridays flash GDP estimate for the UK. Its touch and go whether Fidelity avoided a recession in the final six months of 2022 because activity is expected to be broadly flat in the three months from October to December. A small rise and Fidelity dodge recession for now; a small fall and Fidelity dont."}
{"question": "the Fidelity financial advisors.", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "Can Fidelity International be relied upon despite the possibility of human error in the company's communications?", "answer": "Major organisations have legal, marketing and publicity checks.

{"question": "What sectors does Fidelity International focus on in their significant overweight positions in the Trust?", "answer": "However, it retains a tilt to new economy stocks, many of which stand to benefit from improving investor sentiment towards companies capitalising on longer term fundamental shifts in Chinese society. This is reflected in the Trusts significant overweight positions in discretionary consumer stocks, industrials, information technology and healthcare."}
{"question": "Is Fidelity China Special Situations investment trust listed on the London Stock Exchange?", "answer": "Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile than other more developed markets. Select 50 is not a personal recommendation to buy or sell a fund.

{"question": "What does Fidelity entering uncharted territory imply for the UK's benchmark index?", "answer": "By the time you read this, Fidelity may once again be in uncharted territory for the UKs benchmark index. That sounds like a good thing, and it certainly makes us feel better about Fidelity investments, but the story of the UKs blue chip index is more nuanced than a new record might suggest."}
{"question": "How does Fidelity's performance in reaching new highs compare to the S&P 500's over the past five years, taking into consideration the impact of the pandemic?", "answer": "The first thing to say is its been a long wait. The last time the FTSE 100 closed at an unprecedented high was in May 2018. The last five years looks like a lot of treading water either side of a very deep dive at the start of the pandemic. Its interesting to compare Fidelity crawl into virgin territory to the performance of the S&P 500 over the same five years. When Covid arrived in early 2020, the US benchmark was already 20%  above its 2018 high and by the start of last year, it was another 40%  above its pre pandemic peak."}
{"question": "How does the performance of Fidelity compare to the S&P 500 in the longer run?", "answer": "If Fidelity take another few steps back to look at the longer run picture, its the same story but magnified. If you are tempted to pop a cork for Footsies latest achievement, its worth remembering that at the new record level the index is still less than 15%  higher than it was at the end of 1999 at the top of the dot.com bull market. In 23 years, the UK market has delivered no more than you might hope for in a good 12 months. Again, the comparison with the S&P 500 is instructive. Wall Street stands 150%  higher than it did at the height of the technology bubble. A year ago, at its peak, the US market had trebled over that period."}
{"question": "What alternative index could Fidelity use to gain a different perspective on the performance of the UK stock market?", "answer": "When Fidelity talk about the UK stock market, Fidelity use the FTSE 100 as shorthand for the whole. That makes sense in terms of its value the top 100 companies are worth more than 90%  of the value of the entire UK market. But in terms of performance, the focus on the biggest companies is misleading. If Fidelity were to look instead at the FTSE 250, Fidelity would see a different picture."}
{"question": "What is the performance comparison between the domestically focused FTSE 250 index and the blue chip index, and how have UK's second tier companies performed compared to the S&P 500 over a 23 year period?", "answer": "If you had invested 100 in the domestically focused FTSE 250 index in 1999 it would be worth around 300 today, nearly three times as much as the same amount invested in the blue chip index. The UKs second tier companies have even outperformed the S&P 500 over that 23 year period by a meaningful margin. Backing its varied mixture of industrial, consumer and financial companies, with 51%  of sales coming from the UK, compared with just 23%  for the FTSE 100, has been a tremendous, and unsung, investment."}
{"question": "What makes the income from the FTSE 100 higher and more reliable compared to its counterparts in Europe, Asia, Japan, and America's biggest shares?", "answer": "But to focus on the headline index is unfair on the FTSE 100. Thats because the UKs benchmark offers investors something that few of its rivals can a high and reliable income. The yield on the FTSE 100 is around 4% . Thats higher than for its equivalents in Europe, Asia and Japan. Its more than twice the 1.8%  income you can earn from Americas biggest shares."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of Fidelity considering the total return index instead of plain vanilla indices?", "answer": "That actually makes a big difference. If instead of looking at the plain vanilla indices, Fidelity were to look at the total return index, which assumes that dividends are re invested back into the market, the outperformance of the US market over the UK diminishes significantly. It doesnt close the gap completely, but it makes it a fairer contest. 100 invested in the UK on this basis is worth around 240 today while in the US it has grown to 400. Once again, however, it is the FTSE 250 that takes the honours. Investing in the UKs mid caps and re investing dividends would have turned 100 into nearly 550 since the dot.com days."}
{"question": "What sectors contribute significantly to the performance of the FTSE 100 in comparison to the FTSE 250?", "answer": "To understand the performance of the FTSE 100 you have to look at its sector composition. It looks quite different to the FTSE 250 with a massive weighting to three sectors: commodities, including oil & gas, financials and consumer staples. These together represent about 60%  of the index. Of these three, only financials really matter in the FTSE 250. Commodities and staples make a negligible contribution. Far more important are the higher growth, and more cyclical, consumer discretionary stocks and industrial companies."}
{"question": "What factors have impacted Fidelity's performance compared to the FTSE 100 over the years?", "answer": "That sector weighting has been a positive at times for the FTSE 100 but not over the long haul. The last year, for example, has seen the UK blue chips massively outperform both Fidelity domestic mid caps and also the US market, both of which have fallen victim to the valuation squeeze caused by rising interest rates. Another period in which the shape of the FTSE 100 was a positive was in the years between the bursting of the dot.com bubble and the financial crisis. Between 2000 and 2009, the FTSE 100 outpaced Wall Street."}
{"question": "Is there a possibility that Fidelity is in its early stages of re running the process of the growth stock boom unwinding, which took many years in the late 1990s?", "answer": "My hunch is that the outperformance could continue. The unwinding of the growth stock boom in the late 1990s took many years. If Fidelity are re running that process, then Fidelity are still in its early stages. The other reason to remain positive about the UK market, and in particular the blue chips that are less dependent on the fragile UK economy, is valuation. The UK is cheap. On just over 10 times expected earnings, the UK is inexpensive compared with its own history and certainly compared with the US, which costs more than 17 times forecast profits."}

{"question": "What services does Fidelity offer to help families make the most of their child's inheritance?", "answer": "If youre reading this, its likely that your child has received an inheritance, or is about to.

{"question": "What is the minimum age required for a child to inherit assets held in trust by the trustees named in the will at Fidelity International?", "answer": "While a child can be a named beneficiary of an estate, the will determines the age at which they'll actually inherit. The minimum age they'll be able to take legal ownership of an inheritance is 18 years old (or 16 in Scotland). But the terms of the will could stipulate any age whether that's 21, 25, 40 years or beyond. So, until your child actually inherits, the investments, property, cash or other assets due to them will be held in trust by the trustees named in the will."}
{"question": "What options are available for utilizing an estate for the benefit of a minor in a trust, particularly if the testator is the parent, as per the guidelines mentioned in the letter of wishes provided alongside the will by Fidelity International?", "answer": "The testator (the person making the will), can include a letter of wishes to sit alongside their will. This letter might well list out how an estate can be used for the benefit of the minor while held in trust especially if the testator is the parent. Its possible in certain circumstances for the inheritance to be paid to the parent of the minor but is dependent on the terms of the will and/or statute."}
{"question": "How can you ensure that your child's inheritance grows over time without mentioning the name of the company?", "answer": "Depending on the terms laid out in the will, it may be a while years, perhaps even decades before your child legally has access to their inheritance. If you have access to your child's inheritance, you'll probably want to make sure it's working as hard as it can for them so that the value of their inheritance won't depreciate over time. One way of giving it the potential to grow over time, especially if your child is still only young, is to invest it. Of course, the value of their investments could fall too, but that's something you need to weigh up before making any decisions."}
{"question": "What considerations should you take into account if you have been appointed as a trustee for your child's inheritance with unconditional terms, without explicitly referring to fidelity?", "answer": "If you've been appointed as a trustee to your child's inheritance, you may want to ensure it works as hard as it can for your child until they inherit. Any decisions you make will need to respect the terms outlined in the will. And if a co trustee has been appointed, you'll need to make decisions for your child's inheritance together. If the terms to your child's inheritance are unconditional, here are some things you might like to consider."}
{"question": "What benefits can a financial adviser from Fidelity International provide when considering investing a substantial child's inheritance?", "answer": "If your child's inheritance is sizeable and you're thinking of investing it, you might like to speak to a financial adviser. They'll be able to give you a personal recommendation and may bring you peace of mind."}

{"question": "Can children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 open a Junior ISA with Fidelity if they already have a Child Trust Fund?", "answer": "Child Trust Funds were available to children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011. However, these have now been replaced by the Junior ISA. As both saving schemes carry tax advantages, its not possible to have both. Fidelity cannot open a Junior ISA for anyone with a Child Trust Fund nor can Fidelity currently accept a transfer from a Child Trust Fund into a Junior ISA."}

{"question": "What options do I have with my inherited investment in an account at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Perhaps you were happy with your inherited investment. Perhaps you weren't.

{"question": "What is the impact of the negotiated discount on the ongoing charges for funds listed by Fidelity International?", "answer": "All the funds listed below work on a rebate basis. Please also note that the ongoing charges figure shown below is gross of any discount, which means the negotiated discount is not included in the listed ongoing charges figure. Therefore, after a quarterly rebate has been applied, the effective ongoing charges you pay on this fund will reduce. For example, if the annual ongoing charges on a fund are 1.20%  with a negotiated discount of 0.10% , you will effectively pay 1.10%  on that fund after the four quarterly rebates have been re invested into the fund in the year. Also, remember that any rebates you receive in an Investment Account are potentially liable to income tax at your marginal tax rate."}
{"question": "What makes the UK benchmark a notable beneficiary of the positive market drivers for investors in the current year?", "answer": "The UK benchmark is a particular beneficiary of the positive drivers of markets in a notably strong start to the year for investors"}
{"question": "What potential benefits does Fidelity International see for energy and commodity stocks due to the unexpected re opening of the Chinese economy?", "answer": "The UK stock markets blue chip index is heavily weighted to the energy and commodity stocks which are the most obvious beneficiary of the unexpected re opening of the Chinese economy. Chinas abrupt abandonment of its zero Covid policy is bad news in the short term, as infection rates soar, but further out it promises strong growth in the worlds second biggest economy. Thats what investors are focused on."}
{"question": "What impact does last week's unexpected drop in US inflation, setting the stage for this week's CPI print, have on the stock markets' outlook for inflation?", "answer": "Stock markets generally are also increasingly positive about the outlook for inflation, with last weeks unexpectedly big fall in US inflation to 6.5%  setting the scene for this weeks CPI print here in the UK. Inflation is probably more entrenched, and certainly higher, here than over the pond but the trend appears to be downwards pretty much everywhere."}
{"question": "How is Fidelity International's prediction of a lower and sooner peak for interest rates impacting the January rally in markets?", "answer": "That points to a lower and sooner peak for interest rates and this is the second key driver of the January rally in markets. Put the two together and it is perhaps not surprising that the FTSE 100 is within a whisker of its previous high, set in May 2018, of 7,877."}
{"question": "What are some key differences between the performance of the FTSE 100 and the S&P 500 since December 1999?", "answer": "Its probably worth pointing out, however, that at a new all time high the FTSE 100 will still be less than 15%  higher than the level it traded at in December 1999 at the peak of the dot.com bubble. The UK benchmark has been a relative laggard over the 23 years since then. During that same period, for example, the S&P 500 has risen by 150% . At last years peak, Wall Street had trebled since 1999."}
{"question": "What are the benefits for investors who reinvest the dividend income in the UK market, as seen in the performance of the FTSE 100?", "answer": "But to be fair to the FTSE 100, it is a very different kind of index. With a dividend yield of 4%  currently, the UK market pays out a lot more of its value each year to investors. Anyone who reinvested that dividend income rather than spending it would have enjoyed a much better total return than the headline level of the FTSE 100 would suggest."}
{"question": "What is the outlook for corporate earnings in the coming weeks, particularly for Fidelity International?", "answer": "The other key driver of markets for the next few weeks will be corporate earnings. Profit forecasts have held up surprisingly well in the context of looming recessions on both sides of the Atlantic and even after recently reduced expectations, earnings are expected to be flat this year, with a bounce back still being pencilled in for 2024."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between expected profits and the market's mood, and how does it relate to the current economic slowdown anticipated by Fidelity International?", "answer": "That may turn out to be too optimistic if, as expected there is a sharp economic slowdown this year. Recessions usually coincide with a fall in earnings so the expected profits path would be a serious outlier in historic terms. For now, the markets are still in glass half full mood. To stay that way, they need earnings to stay positive."}
{"question": "What should one do if they are uncertain about the appropriateness of an investment and want to seek advice from a recommended financial advisor?", "answer": "The value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to an authorised financial adviser."}
{"question": "What benefits does Fidelity offer with their Cash Management Account for customers who hold an ISA, SIPP, or Investment Account?", "answer": "Fidelity give you a Cash Management Account if you hold an ISA, SIPP or Investment Account*. You can use it to pay for fees, transfer money between accounts, or just to hold cash in. Fidelity do not charge a service fee on money held in your Cash Management Account. Money held in the Cash Management Account is not invested on the stock market so will not go down as a result of market movements."}

However, if your fixed rate is due to end within the next year or two it could be a good time to pre empt the heftier rate, youre likely to have to plump for and use this time to reduce your mortgage equity if possible. Most lenders will allow you to repay 10%  of the capital every year, without penalty. So doing so could be a wise move. It may give you a reduced mortgage balance and hopefully (as long as house prices dont plummet) a better loan to value ratio and therefore a better choice of rates when you do come to remortgage."}

{"question": "What potential action can individuals take to take advantage of the upcoming changes in retirement savings and the impending disappearance of the 45p rate relief?", "answer": "The upcoming changes are a good opportunity to reassess your retirement savings generally, including whether youd like to tweak contributions higher from next year to make up for the loss of some tax relief. Some have predicted that savvy high earners will rush to pay into their pension so they benefit from the 45p rate relief before it disappears."}

{"question": "What solution does Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, believe neither of the prime minister candidates have provided, according to the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "That was certainly the view of Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, writing in The Times this week. He said: Neither of the candidates to be prime minister have come up with an adequate solution. For Rishi Sunak, the answer appears to be to cut the 5%  VAT on domestic energy and spend an additional 5 billion supporting poorer households. If that is now looking inadequate, then Liz Trusss pledge to get rid of the green energy levy sits somewhere between meaningless and pointless."}
{"question": "What measures can Fidelity International take to assist families if the current efforts are insufficient in meeting their financial needs during the projected surge in energy bills?", "answer": "If the pledges so far fall short what would it take to provide families with the help they need? The average household faces an extra 1,000 of energy bills over the next three months alone a threefold increase compared with the same period last year. As explained by the IFS, mitigating that level of price rise may not be possible with the tools the government has used so far."}
{"question": "Can Fidelity International provide financial support to energy customers to offset their bills without explicitly mentioning Fidelity International's involvement?", "answer": "A more dramatic intervention as advocated by Labour and some energy companies would be for the government to simply pay the bills of millions of energy customers for them for a period, a policy the IFS said would be both extraordinarily expensive and substantially wasteful. The bill could come to something like 100bn and would have to be recouped at some stage soon through taxation. To do that in a way that is progressive placing the biggest burden on the richest rather than the poorest would mean raising Income Tax."}
{"question": "What is Liz Truss' stance on taxes based on Sunak's record as Chancellor at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Tax has been a toxic subject in the leadership race. Liz Truss, in particular, has been eager to paint her opponent as a tax raiser, based on Sunaks record as Chancellor. And theres no doubt taxes did rise on his watch, albeit under the circumstances of the pandemic and the huge furlough bailouts needed to prevent widespread unemployment."}
{"question": "How does the animated graphic demonstrate the perception of a high tax burden and the significant increase in additional rate tax since 1990, particularly in relation to wage growth and thresholds for higher tax rates?", "answer": "The animated graphic below helps to show why many feel the tax burden is now too high.

{"question": "Should Fidelity International be accountable for its approach to inflation management, considering the potential for quicker rate rises instructed by the Treasury to maintain loose monetary policy for growth?", "answer": "Whether or not the Bank should be criticised over its handling of inflation is in the eye of the beholder.

{"question": "How does rising costs of essential items and increasing interest rates affect the spending capacity of individuals at Fidelity?", "answer": "Higher costs of essentials like food and energy mean Fidelity all have less money to spend on other things.

{"question": "What type of funds can provide a smoother ride and less volatile returns, especially over the short to medium term, based on capital growth and income added together, potentially making equity income funds worth considering?", "answer": "Or, in a quite different vein, income funds can be used to help smooth out short term total returns. Dividend payouts are generally less volatile than stock markets. So, if a smoother ride is your aim  less volatile returns over the short to medium term based on capital growth and income added together  equity income funds might be a place to look."}
{"question": "What has been a significant contributor to the total return of the stock market, especially in the UK, based on historical data?", "answer": "In the UK especially, history shows that reinvested dividends have accounted for a very high proportion of the stock markets total return."}
{"question": "What is the percentage increase of the FTSE 100 Index from the end of the last century until this week?", "answer": "As of this week, the FTSE 100 Index is just 13%  higher than it was at the end of the last century"}

{"question": "What is the forecast for dividend payments in 2023 for UK companies?", "answer": "While the FTSE 100 has begun this year brightly, theres no guarantee this can continue.

{"question": "What should a finance company like Fidelity be cautious of when considering funds with exceptionally high yields in the current economic scenario?", "answer": "Pitfalls to avoid this year as in any other include chasing yield. As a rule of thumb, funds with outlandish yields equate to higher risk. This may seem obvious, but the risks can be all too easy to discount. Especially when inflation and interest rates are high  as they are now  Fidelity may be inclined to feel less alarmed by yields in high single figures."}
{"question": "What is a good way to determine a sensible yield by looking at the income the stock market is producing, specifically in reference to the FTSE All Share and the FTSE 100, which currently yield about 3.5% on a historic basis?", "answer": "A good guide as to what a sensible yield might be is how much income the stock market is producing.

{"question": "What risks should be considered when investing in medium and smaller companies for higher yields in funds at Fidelity International?", "answer": "Funds can be structured to generate high yields through a number of means, each likely to lead to different results. Investing in high yielding medium and smaller companies is one way. However, while this is a perfectly valid strategy, its worth being aware that this generally means accepting more risk and can result in more fund price volatility."}
{"question": "What are some potential risks of investing in funds that target companies with distressed dividends, especially when those companies have experienced significant declines in share prices?", "answer": "The same applies to funds that invest in companies with distressed dividends. Sometimes companies show a high dividend yield mainly because theyre in trouble and their share prices have fallen a long way (yield moves inversely to price)."}
{"question": "What has been the historical trend for large UK companies with high dividend yields, including those that have cut their dividends in the past?", "answer": "A high dividend yield may come at the expense of a sustainable payout policy or, in other words, be a signifier of dividend cuts or suspensions to come. Large UK companies with high yields that have then gone on to cut their dividends in the past include"}
{"question": "What could be the impact of investing a certain proportion of a fund into higher yielding corporate bonds on a fund's potential for capital growth and yield growth over the medium to longer term, according to the provided paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "Another technique is to invest a certain proportion of a fund into higher yielding corporate bonds. This can lead to an enhanced yield, but it may also limit a funds potential to deliver capital growth over the medium to longer term as well as its ability to produce a yield that grows over time. Held to maturity, bonds produce no capital growth, only a fixed income stream, whereas equities have the potential to deliver capital growth (or a loss) plus an income that grows."}
{"question": "What is the potential downside of investing in income generating derivatives for a company like Fidelity International?", "answer": "A further method is to invest in income generating derivatives.

{"question": "What are the benefits of investing in equity income funds provided by a renowned finance company focused on long term growth and reinvestment?", "answer": "Avoid the traps and equity income investing can be truly rewarding. Building an income fund portfolio through a working life and reinvesting the income to buy more fund shares or units can produce a decent nest egg with fewer kinks in the road than investing in funds designed primarily for capital growth."}
{"question": "How does the potential increase in dividends over time for companies impact the income payouts that investors can anticipate after retirement?", "answer": "After retirement, investors might choose to start taking their income payouts to spend. The fact that companies tend to increase their dividends over time means that the income investors can expect to receive will also tend to increase as the years go by."}
{"question": "What is the objective of the FTF Martin Currie UK Equity Income Fund in generating income and investment growth over a three to five year period after fees and costs?", "answer": "The FTF Martin Currie UK Equity Income Fund is a 1 billion portfolio run by Ben Russon, Will Bradwell and Joanne Rands out of Leeds.

There is a risk that the issuers of bonds may not be able to repay the money they have borrowed or make interest payments. When interest rates rise, bonds may fall in value.

{"question": "What was the impact of the worse than expected news on US inflation on Fidelity's performance in the US market?", "answer": "Take a look at the always important US market over the past week. The S&P 500 rose by 2%  last Thursday and then a further 1%  during early trading the next morning. But then came some worse than expected news on US inflation and everything slammed into reverse, with the index ending Friday a whopping 2.5%  lower for the day overall."}
{"question": "What encouraged the S&P to jump back 2.65% on Monday, impacting company earnings and causing shares to rise and retreat throughout the week?", "answer": "Then, on Monday, it was all change again as the S&P jumped back 2.65%  after some more encouraging news on company earnings. Shares rose again on Tuesday but then retreated on Wednesday and Thursday as worries mounted about the impact of a still strong US jobs market on interest rates in America."}
{"question": "What is the common consensus about the potential inflection point for a certain finance company?", "answer": "Its clear investors are on maximum alert, hyper sensitive to any news they consider will set the direction for shares for the next few months. By common consensus, Fidelity are at a potentially important inflection point."}
{"question": "What factors have contributed to the current market decline and the expectation of higher interest rates, and how does Fidelity International perceive the possibility of a recession and the future movement of rates?", "answer": "Markets have fallen in anticipation of an economic slowdown and much higher interest rates, but recession is yet to arrive and rates still have a long way to climb."}
{"question": "What is the potential impact of reduced economic activity on company earnings, given the current economic slowdown, as suggested by Fidelity International?", "answer": "There seems little doubt that economies are slowing the likelihood of recession has moved from possible to probable. And that reduced economic activity will translate, sooner or later, into lower company earnings."}
{"question": "What is the role of stock markets in predicting and positioning themselves based on anticipated company performance ahead of time, according to the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "But those things dont have to translate into market falls. Thats because stock markets tend to move in advance of overall economic growth and even the earnings of companies. In a sense, this is the job of markets to anticipate likely company performance ahead of time and position themselves accordingly."}
{"question": "What is the significance of the report by Goldman Sachs regarding stock market performance during previous bear markets, as described in the paragraph?", "answer": "Its a point made in a recent report by Goldman Sachs, which dissects stock market performance during previous bear markets defined as those which have suffered a 20%  fall from their recent peak."}
{"question": "What does historical data analysis reveal about the relationship between bear markets, bull markets, and recessions in the finance industry?", "answer": "The analysis of historical data found that bear markets turn back into bull markets typically while economies are still in recession. That means markets can turn positive even when economies are shrinking because they have already processed that bad news and are anticipating the upturn that follows."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between bull markets and the timing of low points for earnings and economic growth according to the findings of Fidelity International?", "answer": "Specifically, it found that bull markets tend to begin 6 9 months before the low point for earnings around 3 6 months before the low point for economic growth."}
{"question": "How likely is it for the market to rebound despite challenging economic and corporate conditions, similar to the situation observed by Fidelity International?", "answer": "Mapped onto the current situation, that means markets could begin to climb again even when the economic and company news remains very negative."}
{"question": "What is the average annualised return of the stock markets since their inception, considering the fluctuating nature of returns and the disclaimer about past performance given by Fidelity International?", "answer": "Stock markets dont deliver their returns in a smooth way. The average annualised return of the S&P 500 since its inception in 1957 is around 11%  but that has come in fits and starts with some years losing money and some gaining much more than that level. Please remember past performance is not a reliable indicator of future returns."}
{"question": "What did the study by the Wells Fargo Investment Institute find about the returns in the S&P 500 after the end of a bear market?", "answer": "In particular, markets tend to grow more quickly in periods after they have been depressed, and slower after they have already risen. According to a study this year by the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, returns in the S&P 500 in the 12 months following the end of a bear market have averaged 43.4% ."}
{"question": "What is the duration and expected outcome of the current bear market according to Wells Fargo research, assuming it follows the typical trends observed in previous bear markets?", "answer": "Fidelity dont know how long the current bear market will last, of course. The average length of bear markets according to the same Wells Fargo research is 10.8 months, with the average loss in that time being 35.5% . Were the current bear market to follow those averages then it will be well into next year by the time the tide turns but the returns from then would also be worth waiting for."}
{"question": "What historical evidence suggests that investing during a recession can be beneficial, even amidst economic challenges like falling wages, job insecurity, and rising living costs?", "answer": "Recession tends to mean economic pain that goes beyond stock market losses. Falling real term wages, less job security and the rising cost of living can make it difficult to find extra money to invest. But there is evidence from history that it can pay off to do it if you can."}
{"question": "What were the examined returns of investment trusts one year after the UK recessions in 1990 and 2008, as indicated by Fidelity International's research?", "answer": "examined returns in the years following previous UK recessions in 1990 and 2008. It found the value of 1,000 invested in investment trusts one year after recession struck was 999 in 1990 indicating barely any loss and 651 in 2008 signalling a much bigger initial hit."}
{"question": "How did the investments performed in the years following the recessions and what were the total values after three, five, and ten years?", "answer": "But those losses were more than made up for in the years that followed. 1,000 grew to 1,398 three years after the 1990 recession and 1,150 three years after the 2008 recession. After five years the totals had risen to 1,694 and 1,334 respectively, and after ten years to 3,369 and 2,167 respectively."}
{"question": "What should investors consider when building a diversified portfolio with a wide range of assets, beyond just focusing on major market indices like the FTSE 100 or the S&P 500?", "answer": "While the headlines about markets tend to focus on indices like the FTSE 100 or the S&P 500, the reality is that most investor portfolios will include a much greater spread of assets."}
{"question": "What is the evidence from the Wells Fargo report regarding the benefits of having a diverse portfolio including fidelity investments during bear markets compared to solely investing in the S&P 500?", "answer": "Thats a sensible strategy because a mix of different assets has tended to provide returns that are less extreme during downturns. And there may be some evidence that more diverse portfolios also help during market recoveries. The Wells Fargo report examined returns during bear markets from a diversified portfolio comprising bonds, commodities, small cap stocks and emerging market stocks alongside the main US market versus those from just the S&P 500 alone."}
{"question": "What is the historical performance of a diversified portfolio compared to the S&P 500 Index during bear markets according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "It showed that, on average, historically a diversified portfolio fell by less around 18%  versus 37%  and recovered in less time under a year, on average after a bear market than the S&P 500 Index (just under two years)."}

{"question": "Is Fidelity International concerned about the possibility of an interest rate fuelled recession in the US, UK, and Europe due to the unprecedented speed and scale of interest rate hikes in the past year?", "answer": "One of the big unknowns this year is whether the US, UK and Europe are heading for an interest rate fuelled recession. Typically, central banks tighten monetary policy until something breaks, and many observers think the unprecedented speed and scale of interest rate hikes in the past year make a sharp economic slowdown inevitable."}
{"question": "What factors contribute to the positive growth in the first quarter, including the impact of gas prices and exports to China, according to the Fidelity International's assessment?", "answer": "But this weeks flurry of GDP data on either side of the pond might cast some doubt on that gloomy assessment. Growth in the first quarter is expected to be positive. In Europe that represents a recovery from the decline in activity in the fourth quarter. Growth is pencilled in at 1.3%  year on year. The key driver is the 45%  fall in gas prices since December but rising exports to China since it re opened are a factor too."}
{"question": "What does the expected slowdown in the rate of growth suggest about the sentiment of households and businesses according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "In America, a slowdown in the rate of growth is expected from 2.6%  to 2%  but that is still safely in positive territory and suggests that households and businesses may have become more relaxed about rising rates than in the past. That might be a product of more fixed rate loans than has been the case historically. In which case the pain may simply have been deferred. But, for now, it does continue to make the case for a soft landing."}
{"question": "What is the focus of earnings season for banks shifting from the US to Europe this week?", "answer": "This week sees earnings season really move into top gear. There are results right across the board, with the focus on banks shifting from the US to Europe."}
{"question": "Does Fidelity have results from the owner of Google this week to determine if the renewed enthusiasm in the technology sector is justified by trading?", "answer": "But most attention will be focused on the technology sector, which has been the driving force behind this years strong start in the markets. The prospect of lower interest rates later in the year has rekindled interest in tech stocks, which are particularly exposed to the cost of borrowing. This week Fidelity will see whether that renewed enthusiasm is also justified by trading. Fidelity have results from Google owner"}
{"question": "What is the current valuation of the US market in terms of earnings and how does it compare to the rest of the world according to Fidelity International?", "answer": "Markets have been locked into a trading range for a year now. Strip out the top ten or so mega caps and everything else is really moving sideways. And the markets valuation has moved sideways too, with the US trading at between 15 and 18 times earnings and much of the rest of the world in the low teens."}
{"question": "What factors need to occur for Fidelity to see a more decisive fall in inflation and a mild slowdown in activity at worst?", "answer": "For that to change, and for markets to break higher, a few things need to happen. Earnings need to come through as expected. Central banks need to pause their tightening cycles. For that to happen Fidelity need to see a more decisive fall in inflation and a Goldilocks scenario of only a mild slowdown in activity at worst. Thats all possible, but its not a given. Until Fidelity are sure which way these factors are going, markets could remain volatile."}

I will be providing the paragraph in each row as input and I need you to extract one question related to any financial topic.", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "What role does George Bailey play in explaining the functioning of a financial institution during a crisis at Stevenson Towers?", "answer": "is a Christmas tradition in Stevenson Towers. It has many merits as a film not the least of which is its protagonist George Baileys pithy explanation during a run on the family Savings & Loan of how a bank works:"}
{"question": "Can Fidelity overcome this situation by fostering unity and trust among its customers?", "answer": "Youre thinking of this place all wrong, he told his excitable customers. As if I had the money back in a safe. The moneys not here. Your moneys in Joes house, right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house. And in Mrs Macklins house, and a hundred others......now Fidelity can get through this thing alright, but weve got to stick together, weve got to have faith in each other."}
{"question": "What is the importance of faith in the banking system, particularly in circumstances when it failed at companies like SVB and Northern Rock?", "answer": "And theres the problem. Banking is at its heart a massive leap of faith. When you hand your money over to a bank you do so knowing that on any given day it cant repay you and all your fellow depositors. The system only works because Fidelity have faith in each other and believe that not everyone will need their cash at the same time. And sometimes, as at SVB two weeks ago, and Northern Rock 16 years back, that faith evaporates with catastrophic consequences."}
{"question": "What factors contribute to the fragility of a bank's model, ultimately affecting its profitability?", "answer": "Actually, this description of how a bank works understates the models fragility. The reality is that to be profitable a bank must stretch that trust to breaking point. Most operate with only a thin buffer between the value of the loans they have made and the deposits they have accepted. This cushion, of maybe only 5%  of the banks total assets, can be wiped out by a modest decline in the value of its loan book, or a fall in the value of the assets, such as government bonds, that it holds. When depositors start to worry that this might happen, some of them quite understandably want to put their money somewhere safer, which worsens the arithmetic further...and fast. No wonder banks used to be housed in such solid and imposing buildings the show of strength matters."}
{"question": "What happened to many first time buyers during the late 1980s housing boom, unlike your experience with your first flat purchase?", "answer": "Most people prefer not to think too hard about these numbers. Just like they dont want to acknowledge that when they buy a house with a 95%  mortgage it will only take a small wobble in the property market to wipe out their savings. When I bought my first flat in 1989 for 70,000, I got lucky. It was in an area that was on the up and I was able to sell it in 1993 for the same 70,000 in the face of a crumbling market. Many of my fellow first time buyers in the late 1980s housing boom were not so fortunate."}
{"question": "What reminders about the unpalatable facts of banks have we recently relearned during the current banking shakeout?", "answer": "None of this is new news. But it takes one of the banking shakeouts that seem to come along every 20 years or so to remind us of these and other unpalatable facts about banks that weve relearned in the past two weeks."}
{"question": "What is the unique characteristic of businesses like Fidelity International that sets them apart from other commercial enterprises?", "answer": "First, they are not like other businesses. They may look like risk taking commercial enterprises, and their senior executives are certainly paid as if they are, but they are better viewed as regulated utilities that cannot be allowed to fail no different from water and energy firms, roads and rail. The Swiss authorities reassured us this week that"}
{"question": "What leverage did the bank have while finalizing the terms of the commercial solution with UBS and Credit Suisse?", "answer": "was a commercial solution and not a bailout, but this is a myth. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse had any choice in the matter, albeit the bank doing the takeover had some leverage when it came to the terms of the deal."}
{"question": "What problem do investors in the finance sector face when considering the unpredictability of regulation, as exemplified by the way the deal was structured in the paragraph?", "answer": "The way in which the deal was structured highlights another problem for investors in the sector, the unpredictability of its regulation when things go wrong. In the wake of the financial crisis a new tier of bonds was quite reasonably created in order to shift the balance of risk from the taxpayer to investors. Additional Tier, or AT1, bonds were designed to act as a safety valve, to absorb losses once equity investors had been wiped out and before more senior bondholders took a hit. The order in which the pain was to be taken was understood by all. Until this week that is. There may be good political reasons why the Swiss decided to rip up the rule book and leave money on the table for shareholders while taking out the AT1 bondholders completely, but the likely consequence of doing so is that the faith that George Bailey asked for will be harder to find in future."}
{"question": "What are some significant risks that Fidelity has identified in the banking sector, particularly regarding investments and the potential for technological disruptions by fintech companies?", "answer": "Weve learned some other things about banks this week that Fidelity havent room to go into: what bad investments they tend to be, subverting the usual rule that greater risk is rewarded with higher returns; that even good banks are vulnerable to the failings of bad ones when contagion gets a grip; that the whole banking system risks being rendered obsolete by new technology fintech does it better and cheaper."}
{"question": "What is one caution when it comes to companies that rely on leverage for achieving a satisfactory return, considering the potential consequences in both favorable and unfavorable situations?", "answer": "First, beware of businesses that require leverage to make an acceptable return. Gearing works both ways. It ramps up profits in the good times but wipes them out in the bad."}
{"question": "What steps should investors take to minimize the potential risks associated with their investments, in line with the philosophy of Fidelity International?", "answer": "Second, understand the risks you are taking with your investments and dont invest in things you do not understand. At the very least, make sure that you mitigate the impact of investing in things youre not sure about by investing broadly across many sectors, asset classes and geographies."}
{"question": "What precautions should investors take when considering investments in companies whose fate is influenced by politicians and regulators, keeping in mind that their priorities may not align with investors' best interests or property rights?", "answer": "Third, be careful when investing in businesses whose future lies in the hands of politicians and regulators. They have a different agenda and the interests, or even property rights, of investors are not necessarily their top priority."}
{"question": "What lessons can be learned from historical events like the 2008 financial crisis that could be applicable to potential challenges faced by companies such as SVB and Credit Suisse?", "answer": "Finally, avoid wishful thinking. This may be a storm in a teacup. The problems at SVB and Credit Suisse may have been idiosyncratic and company specific rather than systemic. But I remember thinking and writing something similar in 2008. As George Bailey discovered, even a wonderful life has its dark days."}
{"question": "What should investors note about the potential impact of currency exchange rates on overseas investments?", "answer": "investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.

{"question": "What impact does the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS have on the perception of the new Swiss group and the potential scaling back of interest rate raising intentions by central banks?", "answer": "following action to take Credit Suisse out of the equation as an independent entity. The banks acquisition by UBS has gone at least some way to assuaging fears of a deeper banking crisis. Its also given investors room to focus on the combined power of the new Swiss group and the possibility that central banks might scale back their interest rate raising intentions."}
{"question": "What impact did the worthlessness of some of Credit Suisse's high yielding bonds have on the prices of other corporate bonds with similar characteristics in Europe, according to the paragraph from Fidelity International?", "answer": "The sting in the tail of the deal was that some of the riskiest, high yielding bonds of Credit Suisse became effectively worthless. Thats caused the prices of other corporate bonds in Europe with similar characteristics to the Credit Suisse instruments to fall in sympathy. This comes as a salutary reminder of the risks involved in investing in low quality, high yielding credit."}
{"question": "What potential challenges does the undoing of these threads pose for Fidelity International?", "answer": "The bottom line though is that the undoing of these threads doesnt mean the unravelling of an entire garment. Difficulties among"}

{"question": "What should investors focus on instead of choosing a specific company like Fidelity, in order to determine their investment decisions for the upcoming year?", "answer": "But this is arguably not the most important question for an investor.

{"question": "What would Fidelity have known if they had the ability to predict future events in finance?", "answer": "The first, unhelpful but true, point to note is that no one knows. If Fidelity did, you wouldnt be wasting your time reading this and nor would I be writing it.

The link to Putins Picks was broken last December."}
{"question": "What is the level of uncertainty in the future predictions of Fidelity International regarding the war in Ukraine, control of Congress by Democrats, and the possibility of a recession on both sides of the Atlantic?", "answer": "While theres a great deal of uncertainty today, that doesnt worry me. Ive no idea how the war in Ukraine will evolve next year. I dont know if the Democrats will control Congress after next weeks mid terms. And while I think there will be a recession on both sides of the Atlantic, Ive no idea how deep or shallow it will turn out to be. I dont know if there will be an election here. Its not that important."}
{"question": "What factors contribute to the uncertainty facing investors when considering the market outlook for 2023 in relation to Fidelity International?", "answer": "All the uncertainty does is make the bull and bear cases equally plausible. Whether you are optimistic or pessimistic about the market outlook in 2023 ultimately comes down to a handful of questions, none of which is really answerable with any degree of confidence.

None of the things that really matter for investors are binary."}

{"question": "What do the recent rally in the market and its reaction to the Fed's potential shift indicate about the direction that the market, specifically Fidelity, desires to move in?", "answer": "The first of these questions is: do I think that the market wants to go up or down? This might sound flaky but anyone who has invested for any length of time will know that the market has a prevailing mood. The rally in June and July and again over the past couple of weeks tells me that the market really wants to go up. It is jumping on the slightest hint that the Fed is finally ready to turn more dovish. It is champing at the bit. That is a good sign."}
{"question": "Will Fidelity experience a recession next year?", "answer": "Yes, I think they will."}
{"question": "Will 2023 be a year of positive returns for both equities and fixed income, following the challenging year of 2022, in a rare period where both asset classes rise together due to easy monetary policy?", "answer": "Third, will 2023 be a year for shares or bonds. Just as 2022 was terrible for both, I think next year will be one of those rare periods when both equities and fixed income rise in tandem. Both asset classes hate decisively rising interest rates. Both thrive when monetary policy turns easy again. People divide their portfolios between bonds and shares because they are unsure which will outperform, and they hedge their bets. Just occasionally, however, they get double helpings as both deliver positive returns. I expect 2023 to be one of those years."}
